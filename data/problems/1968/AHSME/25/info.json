{"answer": "C", "latex": "Ace runs with constant speed and Flash runs $x$ times as fast, $x>1$. Flash gives Ace a head start of $y$ yards, and, at a given signal, they start off in the same direction. Then the number of yards Flash must run to catch Ace is:\\\\\n\\\\\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ xy \\qquad\\textbf{(B)}\\ \\frac{y}{x+y} \\qquad\\textbf{(C)}\\ \\frac{xy}{x-1} \\qquad\\textbf{(D)}\\ \\frac{x+y}{x+1} \\qquad\\textbf{(E)}\\ \\frac{x+y}{x-1}$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h455597p2560202", "category": "A"}
