{"answer": "C", "latex": "$A$ and $B$ move uniformly along two straight paths intersecting at right angles in point $O$. When $A$ is at $O$, $B$ is $500$ yards short of $O$. In $2$ minutes, they are equidistant from $O$, and in $8$ minutes more they are again equidistant from $O$. Then the ratio of $A'$s speed to $B'$s speed is:\\\\\n\\\\\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ 4:5 \\qquad\\textbf{(B)}\\ 5:6 \\qquad\\textbf{(C)}\\ 2:3 \\qquad\\textbf{(D)}\\ 5:8 \\qquad\\textbf{(E)}\\ 1:2$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h455608p2560239", "category": "G"}
