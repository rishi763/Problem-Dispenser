{"answer": "289", "latex": "In \\(\\triangle ABC, AB = AC = 10\\) and \\(BC = 12\\). Point \\(D\\) lies strictly between \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) on \\(\\overline{AB}\\) and point \\(E\\) lies strictly between \\(A\\) and \\(C\\) on \\(\\overline{AC}\\) so that \\(AD = DE = EC\\). Then \\(AD\\) can be expressed in the form \\(\\tfrac{p}{q}\\), where \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \\(p + q\\).", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h1604147p9995381", "category": ""}
