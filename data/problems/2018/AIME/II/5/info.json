{"answer": "074", "latex": "Suppose that $x$, $y$, and $z$ are complex numbers such that $xy = -80-320i$, $yz =  60$, and $zx =  -96+24i$, where $i = \\sqrt{-1}$. Then there are real numbers $a$ and $b$ such that $x+y+z = a+bi$. Find $a^2 + b^2$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h1613520p10083313", "category": ""}
