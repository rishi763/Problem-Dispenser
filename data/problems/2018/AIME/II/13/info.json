{"answer": "647", "latex": "Misha rolls a standard, fair six-sided die until she rolls $1$-$2$-$3$ in that order on three consecutive rolls. The probability that she will roll the die an odd number of times is $\\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h1613503p10083222", "category": ""}
