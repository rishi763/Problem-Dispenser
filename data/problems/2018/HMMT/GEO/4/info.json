{"latex": "A paper equilateral triangle of side length $2$ on a table has vertices labeled $A,B,C.$ Let $M$ be the point on the sheet of paper halfway between $A$ and $C.$ Over time, point $M$ is lifted upwards, folding the triangle along segment $BM,$ while $A,B,$ and $C$ on the table. This continues until $A$ and $C$ touch. Find the maximum volume of tetrahedron $ABCM$ at any time during this process.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c129h1590248p9853196", "category": ""}
