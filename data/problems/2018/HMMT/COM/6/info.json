{"latex": "Sarah stands at $(0,0)$ and Rachel stands at $(6,8)$ in the Euclidena plane. Sarah can only move $1$ unit in the positive $x$ or $y$ direction, and Rachel can only move $1$ unit in the negative $x$ or $y$ direction. Each second, Sarah and Rachel see each other, independently pick a direction to move, and move to their new position. Sarah catches Rachel if Sarah and Rachel are every at the same point. Rachel wins if she is able to get $(0,0)$ without being caught; otherwise, Sarah wins. Given that both of them play optimally to maximize their probability of winning, what is the probability that Rachel wins?", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c129h1590388p9854115", "category": ""}
