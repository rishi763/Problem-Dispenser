{"latex": "A permutation of $\\{1, 2, \\dots, 7\\}$ is chosen uniformly at random. A partition of the permutation into contiguous blocks is correct if, when each block is sorted independently, the entire permutation becomes sorted. For example, the permutation $(3, 4, 2, 1, 6, 5, 7)$ can be partitioned correctly into the blocks $[3, 4, 2, 1]$ and $[6, 5, 7]$, since when these blocks are sorted, the permutation becomes $(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)$. Find the expected value of the maximum number of blocks into which the permutation can be partioned correctly.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c129h1590391p9854131", "category": ""}
