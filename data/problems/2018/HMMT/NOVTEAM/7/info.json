{"latex": "A $5\\times5$ grid of squares is filled with integers. Call a rectangle \\textit{corner-odd} if its sides are grid lines and the sum of the integers in its four corners is an odd number. What is the maximum possible number of corner-odd rectangles within the grid?\\\\\n\\\\\nNote: A rectangles must have four distinct corners to be considered \\textit{corner-odd}; i.e. no $1\\times k$ rectangle can be \\textit{corner-odd} for any positive integer $k$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c129h1738051p11290224", "category": ""}
