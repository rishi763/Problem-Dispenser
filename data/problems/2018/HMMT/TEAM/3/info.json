{"latex": "Michelle has a word with $2^n$ letters, where a word can consist of letters from any alphabet. Michelle performs a swicheroo on the word as follows: for each $k = 0, 1, \\ldots, n-1$, she switches the first $2^k$ letters of the word with the next $2^k$ letters of the word. For example, for $n = 3$, Michelle changes \\[\nABCDEFGH \\to BACDEFGH \\to CDBAEFGH \\to EFGHCDBA\n\\]in one switcheroo.\\\\\n\\\\\nIn terms of $n$, what is the minimum positive integer $m$ such that after Michelle performs the switcheroo operation $m$ times on any word of length $2^n$, she will receive her original word?", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c129h1590289p9853476", "category": ""}
