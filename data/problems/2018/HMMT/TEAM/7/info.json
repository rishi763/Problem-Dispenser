{"latex": "Let $[n]$ denote the set of integers $\\left\\{ 1, 2, \\ldots, n \\right\\}$. We randomly choose a function $f:[n] \\to [n]$, out of the $n^n$ possible functions. We also choose an integer $a$ uniformly at random from $[n]$. Find the probability that there exist positive integers $b, c \\geq 1$ such that $f^b(1) = a$ and $f^c(a) = 1$.
