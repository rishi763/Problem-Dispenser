{"latex": "In acute triangle $ABC$, let $D$, $E$, and $F$ be the feet of the altitudes from $A$, $B$, and $C$ respectively, and let $L$, $M$, and $N$ be the midpoints of $BC$, $CA$ and $AB$, respectively. Lines $DE$ and $NL$ intersect at $X$, lines $DF$ and $LM$ intersect at $Y$, and lines $XY$ and $BC$ intersect at $Z$.
