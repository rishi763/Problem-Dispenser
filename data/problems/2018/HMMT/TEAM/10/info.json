{"latex": "Let $n$ and $m$ be positive integers in the range $[1, 10^{10}]$. Let $R$ be the rectangle with corners at $(0, 0), (n, 0), (n, m), (0, m)$ in the coordinate plane. A simple non-self-intersecting quadrilateral with vertices at integer coordinates is called \\textit{far-reaching} if each of its vertices lie on or inside $R$, but each side of $R$ contains at least one vertex of the quadrilateral. Show that there is a far-reaching quadrilateral with area at most $10^6$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c129h1590310p9853595", "category": ""}
