{"latex": "Crisp All, a basketball player, is \\textit{dropping dimes} and nickels on a number line. Crisp drops a dime on every positive multiple of $10$, and a nickel on every multiple of $5$ that is not a multiple of $10$. Crisp then starts at $0$. Every second, he has a $\\frac{2}{3}$ chance of jumping from his current location $x$ to $x+3$, and a $\\frac{1}{3}$ chance of jumping from his current location $x$ to $x+7$. When Crisp jumps on either a dime or a nickel, he stops jumping. What is the probability that Crisp \\textit{stops on a dime}?", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c129h1737701p11286846", "category": ""}
