{"latex": "I have two cents and Bill has $n$ cents. Bill wants to buy some pencils, which come in two different packages. One package of pencils costs 6 cents for 7 pencils, and the other package of pencils costs a \\textit{dime for a dozen} pencils (i.e. 10 cents for 12 pencils). Bill notes that he can spend \\textbf{all} $n$ of his cents on some combination of pencil packages to get $P$ pencils. However, if I \\textit{give my two cents} to Bill, he then notes that he can instead spend \\textbf{all} $n+2$ of his cents on some combination of pencil packages to get fewer than $P$ pencils. What is the smallest value of $n$ for which this is possible?\\\\\n\\\\\nNote: Both times Bill must spend \\textbf{all} of his cents on pencil packages, i.e. have zero cents after either purchase.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c129h1737679p11286785", "category": ""}
