{"latex": "One million \\textit{bucks } (i.e. one million male deer) are in different cells of a $1000 \\times 1000$ grid. The left and right edges of the grid are then glued together, and the top and bottom edges of the grid are glued together, so that the grid forms a doughnut-shaped torus. Furthermore, some of the bucks are \\textit{honest bucks}, who always tell the truth, and the remaining bucks are \\textit{dishonest bucks}, who never tell the truth.\\\\\nEach of the million \\textit{bucks } claims that \"at most one of my neighboring bucks is an \\textit{honest buck}.\" A pair of \\textit{neighboring bucks} is said to be \\textit{buckaroo} if exactly one of them is an  \\textit{honest buck} . What is the minimum possible number of \\textit{buckaroo } pairs in the grid?\\\\\n\\\\\nNote: Two \\textit{bucks } are considered to be \\textit{neighboring } if their cells $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ satisfy either:\\\\\n$x_1 = x_2$ and $y_1 - y_2 \\equiv \\pm1$ (mod $1000$), or $x_1 - x_2 \\equiv \\pm 1$ (mod $1000$) and $y_1 = y_2$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c129h2024131p14240494", "category": ""}
