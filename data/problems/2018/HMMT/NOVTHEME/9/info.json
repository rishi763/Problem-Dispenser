{"latex": "Circle $\\omega_1$ of radius $1$ and circle $\\omega_2$ of radius $2$ are concentric. Godzilla inscribes square $CASH$ in $\\omega_1$ and regular pentagon $MONEY$ in $\\omega_2$. It then writes down all 20 (not necessarily distinct) distances between a vertex of $CASH$ and a vertex of $MONEY$ and multiplies them all together. What is the maximum possible value of his result?", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c129h1737705p11286859", "category": ""}
