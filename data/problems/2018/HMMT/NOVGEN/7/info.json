{"latex": "Anders is solving a math problem, and he encounters the expression $\\sqrt{15!}$. He attempts to simplify this radical as $a\\sqrt{b}$ where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers. The sum of all possible values of $ab$ can be expressed in the form $q\\cdot 15!$ for some rational number $q$. Find $q$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c129h1737487p11285026", "category": ""}
