{"answer": "D", "latex": "Triangle $ABC$ is an isosceles right triangle with $AB=AC=3$. Let $M$ be the midpoint of hypotenuse $\\overline{BC}$. Points $I$ and $E$ lie on sides $\\overline{AC}$ and $\\overline{AB}$, respectively, so that $AI>AE$ and $AIME$ is a cyclic quadrilateral. Given that triangle $EMI$ has area $2$, the length $CI$ can be written as $\\frac{a-\\sqrt{b}}{c}$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive integers and $b$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. What is the value of $a+b+c$?\\\\\n\\\\\n$\n\\textbf{(A) }9 \\qquad\n\\textbf{(B) }10 \\qquad\n\\textbf{(C) }11 \\qquad\n\\textbf{(D) }12 \\qquad\n\\textbf{(E) }13 \\qquad\n$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h1588242p9833166", "category": ""}
