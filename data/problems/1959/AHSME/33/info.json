{"answer": "B", "latex": "A harmonic progression is a sequence of numbers such that their reciprocals are in arithmetic progression.\\\\\nLet $S_n$ represent the sum of the first $n$ terms of the harmonic progression; for example $S_3$ represents the sum of the first three terms.  If the first three terms of a harmonic progression are $3,4,6$, then:\\\\\n$ \\textbf{(A)}\\ S_4=20 \\qquad\\textbf{(B)}\\ S_4=25\\qquad\\textbf{(C)}\\ S_5=49\\qquad\\textbf{(D)}\\ S_6=49\\qquad\\textbf{(E)}\\ S_2=\\frac12 S_4 $", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h548797p3182572", "category": ""}
