{"answer": "A", "latex": "The base of the decimal number system is ten, meaning, for example, that $ 123 = 1\\cdot 10^2 + 2\\cdot 10 + 3$. In the binary system, which has base two, the first five positive integers are $ 1,\\,10,\\,11,\\,100,\\,101$. The numeral $ 10011$ in the binary system would then be written in the decimal system as:\\\\\n\\\\\n$ \\textbf{(A)}\\ 19 \\qquad \n\\textbf{(B)}\\ 40\\qquad \n\\textbf{(C)}\\ 10011\\qquad \n\\textbf{(D)}\\ 11\\qquad \n\\textbf{(E)}\\ 7$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c4h281587p1519240", "category": ""}
