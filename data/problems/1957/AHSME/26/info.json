{"answer": "E", "latex": "From a point within a triangle, line segments are drawn to the vertices. A necessary and sufficient condition that the three triangles thus formed have equal areas is that the point be:\\\\\n\\\\\n$ \\textbf{(A)}\\ \\text{the center of the inscribed circle} \\qquad \\\\\n\\textbf{(B)}\\ \\text{the center of the circumscribed circle}\\qquad \\\\\n\\textbf{(C)}\\ \\text{such that the three angles fromed at the point each be }{120^\\circ}\\qquad \\\\\n\\textbf{(D)}\\ \\text{the intersection of the altitudes of the triangle}\\qquad \\\\\n\\textbf{(E)}\\ \\text{the intersection of the medians of the triangle}$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c4h281604p1519325", "category": ""}
