{"answer": "199", "latex": "Define a regular $n$-pointed star to be the union of $n$ line segments $P_1P_2, P_2P_3,\\ldots, P_nP_1$ such that\\\\\n\\\\\n$\\bullet$ the points $P_1, P_2,\\ldots, P_n$ are coplanar and no three of them are collinear,\\\\\n$\\bullet$ each of the $n$ line segments intersects at least one of the other line segments at a point other than an endpoint,\\\\\n$\\bullet$ all of the angles at $P_1, P_2,\\ldots, P_n$ are congruent,\\\\\n$\\bullet$ all of the $n$ line segments $P_2P_3,\\ldots, P_nP_1$ are congruent, and\\\\\n$\\bullet$ the path $P_1P_2, P_2P_3,\\ldots, P_nP_1$ turns counterclockwise at an angle of less than 180 degrees at each vertex.\\\\\n\\\\\nThere are no regular 3-pointed, 4-pointed, or 6-pointed stars. All regular 5-pointed stars are similar, but there are two non-similar regular 7-pointed stars. How many non-similar regular 1000-pointed stars are there?", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c4h63322p377960", "category": "C"}
