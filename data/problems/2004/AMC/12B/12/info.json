{"answer": "C", "latex": "In the sequence $ 2001, 2002, 2003, \\ldots$, each term after the third is found by subtracting the previous term from the sum of the two terms that precede that term. For example, the fourth term is $ 2001 + 2002 - 2003 = 2000$. What is the $ 2004^\\text{th}$ term in this sequence?\\\\\n\\\\\n$ \\textbf{(A)} - \\! 2004 \\qquad \\textbf{(B)} - \\! 2 \\qquad \\textbf{(C)}\\ 0 \\qquad \\textbf{(D)}\\ 4003 \\qquad \\textbf{(E)}\\ 6007$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c4h249547p1368189", "category": ""}
