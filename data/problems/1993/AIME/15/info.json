{"answer": "997", "latex": "Let $\\overline{CH}$ be an altitude of $\\triangle ABC$. Let $R$ and $S$ be the points where the circles inscribed in the triangles $ACH$ and $BCH$ are tangent to $\\overline{CH}$. If $AB = 1995$, $AC = 1994$, and $BC = 1993$, then $RS$ can be expressed as $m/n$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers.
