{"answer": "250", "latex": "Euler's formula states that for a convex polyhedron with $V$ vertices, $E$ edges, and $F$ faces, $V - E + F = 2$.  A particular convex polyhedron has 32 faces, each of which is either a triangle or a pentagon.  At each of its $V$ vertices, $T$ triangular faces and $P$ pentagonal faces meet.  What is the value of $100P + 10T + V$?", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c4h80794p462598", "category": "G"}
