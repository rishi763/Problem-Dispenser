{"answer": "160", "latex": "Two skaters, Allie and Billie, are at points $A$ and $B$, respectively, on a flat, frozen lake. The distance between $A$ and $B$ is $100$ meters. Allie leaves $A$ and skates at a speed of $8$ meters per second on a straight line that makes a $60^\\circ$ angle with $AB$. At the same time Allie leaves $A$, Billie leaves $B$ at a speed of $7$ meters per second and follows the straight path that produces the earliest possible meeting of the two skaters, given their speeds. How many meters does Allie skate before meeting Billie?\\\\\n\\\\\n\n\\begin{asy}\nimport olympiad;\nimport cse5;\ndefaultpen(white);\nsize(100);\n\ndefaultpen(linewidth(0.8));\ndraw((100,0)--origin--60*dir(60), EndArrow(5));\nlabel(\"$A$\", origin, SW);\nlabel(\"$B$\", (100,0), SE);\nlabel(\"$100$\", (50,0), S);\nlabel(\"$60^\\circ$\", (15,0), N);\n\\end{asy}\n\\\\\n", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c4h75855p436319", "category": "G"}
