{"answer": "947", "latex": "A sample of 121 integers is given, each between 1 and 1000 inclusive, with repetitions allowed. The sample has a unique mode (most frequent value). Let $D$ be the difference between the mode and the arithmetic mean of the sample. What is the largest possible value of $\\lfloor D\\rfloor$? (For real $x$, $\\lfloor x\\rfloor$ is the greatest integer less than or equal to $x$.)", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c4h75902p436579", "category": "N"}
