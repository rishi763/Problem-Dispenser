{"answer": "D", "latex": "An equilateral triangle is drawn with a side of length $ a$. A new equilateral triangle is formed by joining the midpoints of the sides of the first one. Then a third equilateral triangle is formed by joining the midpoints of the sides of the second; and so on forever. The limit of the sum of the perimeters of all the triangles thus drawn is:\\\\\n\\\\\n$ \\textbf{(A)}\\ \\text{Infinite} \\qquad\\textbf{(B)}\\ 5\\frac {1}{4}a \\qquad\\textbf{(C)}\\ 2a \\qquad\\textbf{(D)}\\ 6a \\qquad\\textbf{(E)}\\ 4\\frac {1}{2}a$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c4h254852p1392621", "category": "G"}
