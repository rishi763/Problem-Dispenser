{"answer": "C", "latex": "The pressure $ (P)$ of wind on a sail varies jointly as the area $ (A)$ of the sail and the square of the velocity $ (V)$ of the wind. The pressure on a square foot is $ 1$ pound when the velocity is $ 16$ miles per hour. The velocity of the wind when the pressure on a square yard is $ 36$ pounds is:\\\\\n\\\\\n$ \\textbf{(A)}\\ 10\\frac {2}{3} \\text{ mph} \\qquad\\textbf{(B)}\\ 96 \\text{ mph} \\qquad\\textbf{(C)}\\ 32\\text{ mph} \\qquad\\textbf{(D)}\\ 1\\frac {2}{3} \\text{ mph} \\qquad\\textbf{(E)}\\ 16 \\text{ mph}$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c4h254881p1392717", "category": "A"}
