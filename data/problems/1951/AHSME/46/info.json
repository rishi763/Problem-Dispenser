{"answer": "A", "latex": "$ AB$ is a fixed diameter of a circle whose center is $ O$. From $ C$, any point on the circle, a chord $ CD$ is drawn perpendicular to $ AB$. Then, as $ C$ moves over a semicircle, the bisector of angle $ OCD$ cuts the circle in a point that always:\\\\\n\\\\\n$ \\textbf{(A)}\\ \\text{bisects the arc } AB \\qquad\\textbf{(B)}\\ \\text{trisects the arc } AB \\qquad\\textbf{(C)}\\ \\text{varies}$\\\\\n$ \\textbf{(D)}\\ \\text{is as far from }AB \\text{ as from } D \\qquad\\textbf{(E)}\\ \\text{is equidistant from }B \\text{ and } C$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c4h254903p1392813", "category": "A"}
