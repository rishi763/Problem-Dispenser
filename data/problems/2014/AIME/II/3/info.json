{"answer": "720", "latex": "A rectangle has sides of length $a$ and $36$. A hinge is installed at each vertex of the rectangle and at the midpoint of each side of length $36$. The sides of length $a$ can be pressed toward each other keeping those two sides parallel so the rectangle becomes a convex hexagon as shown. When the figure is a hexagon with the sides of length $a$ parallel and separated by a distance of $24,$ the hexagon has the same area as the original rectangle. Find $a^2$.\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\n\\begin{asy}\nimport olympiad;\nimport cse5;\ndefaultpen(white);\nsize(100);\n\npair A,B,C,D,E,F,R,S,T,X,Y,Z;\ndotfactor = 2;\nunitsize(.1cm);\nA = (0,0);\nB = (0,18);\nC = (0,36);\n\n// don't look here\n\nD = (12*2.236, 36);\nE = (12*2.236, 18);\nF = (12*2.236, 0);\ndraw(A--B--C--D--E--F--cycle);\ndot(\" \",A,NW);\ndot(\" \",B,NW);\ndot(\" \",C,NW);\ndot(\" \",D,NW);\ndot(\" \",E,NW);\ndot(\" \",F,NW);\n\n//don't look here\n\nR = (12*2.236 +22,0);\nS = (12*2.236 + 22 - 13.4164,12);\nT = (12*2.236 + 22,24);\nX = (12*4.472+ 22,24);\nY = (12*4.472+ 22 + 13.4164,12);\nZ = (12*4.472+ 22,0);\ndraw(R--S--T--X--Y--Z--cycle);\ndot(\" \",R,NW);\ndot(\" \",S,NW);\ndot(\" \",T,NW);\ndot(\" \",X,NW);\ndot(\" \",Y,NW);\ndot(\" \",Z,NW);\n\n\n// sqrt180 = 13.4164\n// sqrt5 = 2.236\n\n\n\\end{asy}\n\\\\\n", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h582688p3444099", "category": "G"}
