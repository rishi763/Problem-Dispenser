{"answer": "028", "latex": "Ten adults enter a room, remove their shoes, and toss their shoes into a pile. Later, a child randomly pairs each left shoe with a right shoe without regard to which shoes belong together. The probability that for every positive integer $k<5,$ no collection of $k$ pairs made by the child contains the shoes from exactly $k$ of the adults is $\\tfrac{m}{n},$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h582698p3444118", "category": "C"}
