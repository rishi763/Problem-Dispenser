{"latex": "Let $ABC$ be an acute triangle with circumcenter $O$ such that $AB=4$, $AC=5$, and $BC=6$.  Let $D$ be the foot of the altitude from $A$ to $BC$, and $E$ be the intersection of $AO$ with $BC$.  Suppose that $X$ is on $BC$ between $D$ and $E$ such that there is a point $Y$ on $AD$ satisfying $XY\\parallel AO$ and $YO\\perp AX$.  Determine the length of $BX$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c129h578713p3414347", "category": ""}
