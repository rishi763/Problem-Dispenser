{"latex": "$ABC$ is a triangle such that $BC = 10$, $CA = 12$. Let $M$ be the midpoint of side $AC$. Given that $BM$ is parallel to the external bisector of $\\angle A$, find area of triangle $ABC$. (Lines $AB$ and $AC$ form two angles, one of which is $\\angle BAC$. The external angle bisector of $\\angle A$ is the line that bisects the other angle.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c129h577909p3408100", "category": ""}
