{"latex": "Two circles are said to be \\textit{orthogonal} if they intersect in two points, and their tangents at either point of intersection are perpendicular. Two circles $\\omega_1$ and $\\omega_2$ with radii $10$ and $13$, respectively, are externally tangent at point $P$. Another circle $\\omega_3$ with radius $2\\sqrt2$ passes through $P$ and is orthogonal to both $\\omega_1$ and $\\omega_2$. A fourth circle $\\omega_4$, orthogonal to $\\omega_3$, is externally tangent to $\\omega_1$ and $\\omega_2$. Compute the radius of $\\omega_4$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c129h577916p3408113", "category": ""}
