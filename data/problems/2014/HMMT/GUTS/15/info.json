{"latex": "Given a regular pentagon of area $1$, a pivot line is a line not passing through any of the pentagon's vertices such that there are $3$ vertices of the pentagon on one side of the line and $2$ on the other. A pivot point is a point inside the pentagon with only finitely many non-pivot lines passing through it. Find the area of the region of pivot points.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c129h586234p3467870", "category": ""}
