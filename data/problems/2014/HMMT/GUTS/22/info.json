{"latex": "Let $\\omega$ be a circle, and let $ABCD$ be a quadrilateral inscribed in $\\omega$.  Suppose that $BD$ and $AC$ intersect at a point $E$.  The tangent to $\\omega$ at $B$ meets line $AC$ at a point $F$, so that $C$ lies between $E$ and $F$.  Given that $AE=6$, $EC=4$, $BE=2$, and $BF=12$, find $DA$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c129h586372p3468888", "category": ""}
