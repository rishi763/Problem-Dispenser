{"latex": "Let $ABC$ be an equilateral triangle of side length $6$ inscribed in a circle $\\omega$.  Let $A_1,A_2$ be the points (distinct from $A$) where the lines through $A$ passing through the two trisection points of $BC$ meet $\\omega$.  Define $B_1,B_2,C_1,C_2$ similarly.  Given that $A_1,A_2,B_1,B_2,C_1,C_2$ appear on $\\omega$ in that order, find the area of hexagon $A_1A_2B_1B_2C_1C_2$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c129h603985p3586744", "category": ""}
