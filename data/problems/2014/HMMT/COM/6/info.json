{"latex": "We have a calculator with two buttons that displays and integer $x$. Pressing the first button replaces $x$ by $\\lfloor \\frac{x}{2} \\rfloor$, and pressing the second button replaces $x$ by $4x+1$. Initially, the calculator displays $0$. How many integers less than or equal to $2014$ can be achieved through a sequence of arbitrary button presses? (It is permitted for the number displayed to exceed 2014 during the sequence. Here, $\\lfloor y \\rfloor$ denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to the real number $y$).", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c129h577618p3406144", "category": ""}
