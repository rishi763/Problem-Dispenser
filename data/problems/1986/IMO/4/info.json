{"latex": "Let $A,B$ be adjacent vertices of a regular $n$-gon ($n\\ge5$) with center $O$. A triangle $XYZ$, which is congruent to and initially coincides with $OAB$, moves in the plane in such a way that $Y$ and $Z$ each trace out the whole boundary of the polygon, with $X$ remaining inside the polygon. Find the locus of $X$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c6h60775p366567", "category": ""}
