{"answer": "936", "latex": "Consider the points $A(0,12)$, $B(10,9)$, $C(8,0)$, and $D(-4,7)$. There is a unique square $S$ such that each of the four points is on a different side of $S$. Let $K$ be the area of $S$. Find the remainder when $10K$ is divided by $1000$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c4h61138p367840", "category": "G"}
