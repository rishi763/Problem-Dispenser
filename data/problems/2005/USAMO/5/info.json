{"latex": "Let $n$ be an integer greater than 1. Suppose $2n$ points are given in the plane, no three of which are collinear. Suppose $n$ of the given $2n$ points are colored blue and the other $n$ colored red. A line in the plane is called a \\textit{balancing line} if it passes through one blue and one red point and, for each side of the line, the number of blue points on that side is equal to the number of red points on the same side.\\\\\nProve that there exist at least two balancing lines.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c6h34319p213018", "category": ""}
