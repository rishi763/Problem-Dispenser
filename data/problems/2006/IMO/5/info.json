{"latex": "Let $P(x)$ be a polynomial of degree $n > 1$ with integer coefficients and let $k$ be a positive integer. Consider the polynomial $Q(x) = P(P(\\ldots P(P(x)) \\ldots ))$, where $P$ occurs $k$ times. Prove that there are at most $n$ integers $t$ such that $Q(t) = t$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c6h101487p572821", "category": "N"}
