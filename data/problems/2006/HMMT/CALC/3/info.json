{"latex": "At time $0$, an ant is at $(1,0)$ and a spider is at $(-1,0)$.  The ant starts walking counterclockwise around the unit circle, and the spider starts creeping to the right along the $x$-axis.  It so happens that the ant's horizontal speed is always half the spider's.  What will the shortest distance ever between the ant and the spider be?", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c129h491341p2755619", "category": ""}
