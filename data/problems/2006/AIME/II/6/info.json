{"answer": "012", "latex": "Square $ABCD$ has sides of length 1. Points $E$ and $F$ are on $\\overline{BC}$ and $\\overline{CD}$, respectively, so that $\\triangle AEF$ is equilateral. A square with vertex $B$ has sides that are parallel to those of $ABCD$ and a vertex on $\\overline{AE}$. The length of a side of this smaller square is $\\displaystyle \\frac{a-\\sqrt{b}}{c}$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive integers and $b$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $a+b+c$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h81167p464913", "category": "G"}
