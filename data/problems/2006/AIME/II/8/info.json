A large equilateral triangle is constructed from four of these paper triangles. Two large triangles are considered distinguishable if it is not possible to place one on the other, using translations, rotations, and/or reflections, so that their corresponding small triangles are of the same color.\\\\\n\\\\\nGiven that there are six different colors of triangles from which to choose, how many distinguishable large equilateral triangles may be formed?", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h81171p464929", "category": "C"}
