{"latex": "Let $S$ be a great circle with pole $P$.  On any great circle through $P$, two points $A$ and $B$ are chosen equidistant from $P$.  For any \\textit{ spherical triangle } $ABC$ (the sides are great circles ares), where $C$ is on $S$, prove that the great circle are $CP$ is the angle bisector of angle $C$.\\\\\n\\\\\n\\textbf{ Note.  } A great circle on a sphere is one whose center is the center of the sphere.  A pole of the great circle $S$ is a point $P$ on the sphere such that the diameter through $P$ is perpendicular to the plane of $S$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c6h424758p2403729", "category": "G"}
