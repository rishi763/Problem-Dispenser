{"answer": "D", "latex": "Let $ r$ be the distance from the origion to a point $ P$ with coordinates $ x$ and $ y$. Designate the ratio $ \\frac{y}{r}$ by $ s$ and the ratio $ \\frac{x}{r}$  by $ c$. Then the values of $ s^2 - c^2$ are limited to the numbers:\\\\\n\\\\\n$ \\textbf{(A)}\\ \\text{less than }{-1}\\text{ are greater than }{+1}\\text{, both excluded}\\qquad\\\\\n\\textbf{(B)}\\ \\text{less than }{-1}\\text{ are greater than }{+1}\\text{, both included}\\qquad \\\\\n\\textbf{(C)}\\ \\text{between }{-1}\\text{ and }{+1}\\text{, both excluded}\\qquad \\\\\n\\textbf{(D)}\\ \\text{between }{-1}\\text{ and }{+1}\\text{, both included}\\qquad \\\\\n\\textbf{(E)}\\ {-1}\\text{ and }{+1}\\text{ only}$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c4h282741p1526211", "category": ""}
