{"answer": "C", "latex": "A particle is placed on the parabola $ y = x^2 - x - 6$ at a point $ P$ whose $ y$-coordinate is $ 6$. It is allowed to roll along the parabola until it reaches the nearest point $ Q$ whose $ y$-coordinate is $ -6$. The horizontal distance traveled by the particle (the numerical value of the difference in the $ x$-coordinates of $ P$ and $ Q$) is:\\\\\n\\\\\n$ \\textbf{(A)}\\ 5\\qquad \n\\textbf{(B)}\\ 4\\qquad \n\\textbf{(C)}\\ 3\\qquad \n\\textbf{(D)}\\ 2\\qquad \n\\textbf{(E)}\\ 1$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c4h282716p1526110", "category": ""}
