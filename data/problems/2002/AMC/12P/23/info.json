{"answer": "A", "latex": "Under the new AMC 10, 12 scoring method, $6$ points are given for each correct answer, $2.5$ points are given for each unanswered question, and no points are given for an incorrect answer. Some of the possible scores between $0$ and $150$ can be obtained in only one way, for example, the only way to obtain a score of $146.5$ is to have 24 correct answers and one unanswered question. Some scores can be obtained in exactly two ways; for example, a score of $104.5$ can be obtained with $17$ correct answers, $1$ unanswered question, and $7$ incorrect, and also with $12$ correct answers and $13$ unanswered questions. There are three scores that can be obtained in exactly three ways.
