{"answer": "B", "latex": "Consider the sequence of numbers: $ 4, 7, 1, 8, 9, 7, 6, \\ldots .$ For $ n > 2$, the $ n$th term of the sequence is the units digit of the sum of the two previous terms. Let $ S_n$ denote the sum of the first $ n$ terms of this sequence. The smallest value of $ n$ for which $ S_n > 10,000$ is:\\\\\n\\\\\n$ \\textbf{(A)}\\ 1992 \\qquad \\textbf{(B)}\\ 1999 \\qquad \\textbf{(C)}\\ 2001 \\qquad \\textbf{(D)}\\ 2002 \\qquad \\textbf{(E)}\\ 2004$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c4h62958p376095", "category": ""}
