{"answer": "803", "latex": "Patio blocks that are hexagons $1$ unit on a side are used to outline a garden by placing the blocks edge to edge with $n$ on each side. The diagram indicates the path of blocks around the garden when $n=5.$\\\\\n\\\\\n\n\\begin{asy}\nimport olympiad;\nimport cse5;\ndefaultpen(white);\nsize(100);\n\nsize(250);int i,j;\nreal r=sqrt(3);\nfor(i=0; i<6; i=i+1) {\nfor(j=0; j<4; j=j+1) {\ndraw(shift(((j*r)*dir(60*i+150)).x, ((j*r)*dir(60*i+150)).y)*shift((4r*dir(60i+30)).x,(4r*dir(60i+30)).y)*polygon(6));\n}}\n\\end{asy}\n\\\\\n\\\\\nIf $n=202,$ then the area of the garden enclosed by the path, not including the path itself, is $m(\\sqrt{3}/2)$ square units, where $m$ is a positive integer.
