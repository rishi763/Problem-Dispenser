{"answer": "401", "latex": "The numbers in the sequence 101, 104, 109, 116, $\\dots$ are of the form $a_n = 100 + n^2$, where $n = 1$, 2, 3, $\\dots$.  For each $n$, let $d_n$ be the greatest common divisor of $a_n$ and $a_{n + 1}$.  Find the maximum value of $d_n$ as $n$ ranges through the positive integers.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c4h79222p453677", "category": "N"}
