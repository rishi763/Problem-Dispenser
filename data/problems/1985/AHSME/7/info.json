{"answer": "E", "latex": "In some computer languages (such as APL), when there are no parentheses in an algebraic expression, the operations are grouped from left to right.   Thus, $ a \\times b - c$ in such languages means the same as $ a(b-c)$ in ordinary algebraic notation.  If $ a \\div b - c + d$ is evaluated in such a language, the result in ordinary algebraic notation would be\\\\\n\\\\\n$ \\textbf{(A)}\\ \\frac{a}{b} - c + d \\qquad \\textbf{(B)}\\ \\frac{a}{b} - c - d \\qquad \\textbf{(C)}\\ \\frac{d + c - b}{a} \\qquad \\textbf{(D)}\\ \\frac{a}{b - c + d} \\qquad \\textbf{(E)}\\ \\frac{a}{b-c-d}$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c4h262047p1424217", "category": ""}
