{"answer": "A", "latex": "Consider the graphs $ y = Ax^2$ and and $ y^2 + 3 = x^2 + 4y$, where $ A$ is a positive constant and $ x$ and $ y$ are real variables.  In how many points do the two graphs intersect?\\\\\n\\\\\n$ \\textbf{(A)}\\ \\text{exactly } 4 \\qquad \\textbf{(B)}\\ \\text{exactly } 2$\\\\\n$ \\textbf{(C)}\\ \\text{at least } 1, \\text{ but the number varies for different positive values of } A$\\\\\n$ \\textbf{(D)}\\ 0 \\text{ for at least one positive value of } A \\qquad \\textbf{(E)}\\ \\text{none of these}$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c4h263086p1429080", "category": ""}
