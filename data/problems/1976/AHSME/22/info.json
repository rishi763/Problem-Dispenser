{"answer": "A", "latex": "Given an equilateral triangle with side of length $s$, consider the locus of all points $\\mathit{P}$ in the plane of the triangle such that the sum of the squares of the distances from $\\mathit{P}$ to the vertices of the triangle is a fixed number $a$. This locus\\\\\n\\\\\n$\\textbf{(A) }\\text{is a circle if }a>s^2\\qquad$\\\\\n\\\\\n$\\textbf{(B) }\\text{contains only three points if }a=2s^2\\text{ and is a circle if }a>2s^2\\qquad$\\\\\n\\\\\n$\\textbf{(C) }\\text{is a circle with positive radius only if }s^2<a<2s^2\\qquad$\\\\\n\\\\\n$\\textbf{(D) }\\text{contains only a finite number of points for any value of }a\\qquad $\\\\\n\\\\\n$\\textbf{(E) }\\text{is none of these}$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h590227p3494778", "category": ""}
