{"answer": "017", "latex": "Nine tiles are numbered $1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 9,$ respectively.  Each of three players randomly selects and keeps three of the tile, and sums those three values.  The probability that all three players obtain an odd sum is $m/n,$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers.  Find $m+n.$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c4h66439p392264", "category": "C"}
