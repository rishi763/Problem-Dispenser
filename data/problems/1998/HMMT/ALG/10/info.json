{"latex": "G. H. Hardy once went to visit Srinivasa Ramanujan in the hospital, and he started the conversation with: \"I came here in taxi-cab number $1729$. That number seems dull to me, which I hope isn't a bad omen.\" \"Nonsense,\" said Ramanujan. \"The number isn't dull at all. It's quite interesting. It's the smallest number that can be expressed as the sum of two cubes in two different ways.\" Ramujan had immediately seen that $1729=12^3+1^3=10^3+9^3$. What is the smallest positive integer representable as the sum of the cubes of \\textit{three} positive integers in two different ways?", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c129h485079p2718020", "category": ""}
