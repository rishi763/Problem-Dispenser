{"latex": "Edward, the author of this test, had to escape from prison to work in the grading room today. He stopped to rest at a place $1,875$ feet from the prison and was spotted by a guard with a crossbow.\\\\\n\\\\\nThe guard fired an arrow with an initial velocity of $100 \\dfrac{\\text{ft}}{\\text{s}}$.  At the same time, Edward started running away with an acceleration of $1 \\dfrac{\\text{ft}}{\\text{s}^2}$.  Assuming that air resistance causes the arrow to decelerate at $1 \\dfrac{\\text{ft}}{\\text{s}^2}$, and that it does hit Edward, how fast was the arrow moving at the moment of impact (in $\\dfrac{\\text{ft}}{\\text{s}}$)?", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c129h485107p2718172", "category": ""}
