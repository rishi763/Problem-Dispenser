{"latex": "Given any two positive real numbers $x$ and $y$, then $x\\Diamond y$ is a positive real number defined in terms of $x$ and $y$ by some fixed rule.  Suppose the operation $x\\Diamond y$ satisfies the equations $(x\\cdot y)\\Diamond y=x(y\\Diamond y)$ and $(x\\Diamond 1)\\Diamond x=x\\Diamond 1$ for all $x,y>0$.  Given that $1\\Diamond 1=1$, find $19\\Diamond 98$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c129h485062p2717987", "category": ""}
