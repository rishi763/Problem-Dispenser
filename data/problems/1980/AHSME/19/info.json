{"answer": "D", "latex": "Let $C_1$, $C_2$ and $C_3$ be three parallel chords of a circle on the same side of the center. The distance between $C_1$ and $C_2$ is the same as the distance between $C_2$ and $C_3$. The lengths of the chords are 20, 16, and 8. The radius of the circle is\\\\\n$\\text{(A)} \\ 12 \\qquad \\text{(B)} \\ 4\\sqrt{7} \\qquad \\text{(C)} \\ \\frac{5\\sqrt{65}}{3} \\qquad \\text{(D)} \\ \\frac{5\\sqrt{22}}{2} \\qquad \\text{(E)} \\ \\text{not uniquely determined}$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c4h68122p400437", "category": "G"}
