{"answer": "B", "latex": "A bug (of negligible size) starts at the origin on the coordinate plane. First, it moves one unit right to $(1,0)$. Then it makes a $90^\\circ$ counterclockwise and travels $\\frac 12$ a unit to $\\left(1, \\frac 12 \\right)$. If it continues in this fashion, each time making a $90^\\circ$ degree turn counterclockwise and traveling half as far as the previous move, to which of the following points will it come closest?\\\\\n\\\\\n$\\text{(A)} \\ \\left(\\frac 23, \\frac 23 \\right) \\qquad \\text{(B)} \\ \\left( \\frac 45, \\frac 25 \\right) \\qquad \\text{(C)} \\ \\left( \\frac 23, \\frac 45 \\right) \\qquad \\text{(D)} \\ \\left(\\frac 23, \\frac 13 \\right) \\qquad \\text{(E)} \\ \\left(\\frac 25, \\frac 45 \\right)$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c4h68050p399968", "category": "A"}
