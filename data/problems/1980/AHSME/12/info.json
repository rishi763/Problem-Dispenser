{"answer": "C", "latex": "The equations of $L_1$ and $L_2$ are $y=mx$ and $y=nx$, respectively. Suppose $L_1$ makes twice as large of an angle with the horizontal (measured counterclockwise from the positive x-axis ) as does $L_2$, and that $L_1$ has 4 times the slope of $L_2$. If $L_1$ is not horizontal, then $mn$ is\\\\\n\\\\\n$\\text{(A)} \\ \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\qquad \\text{(B)} \\ -\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\qquad \\text{(C)} \\ 2 \\qquad \\text{(D)} \\ -2 \\qquad \\text{(E)} \\ \\text{not uniquely determined}$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c4h68049p399959", "category": "A"}
