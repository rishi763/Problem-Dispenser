{"latex": "In the Euclidean three-dimensional space, we call \\textit{folding} of a sphere $S$ every partition of $S \\setminus \\{x,y\\}$ into disjoint circles, where $x$ and $y$ are two points of $S$. A folding of $S$ is called \\textbf{linear} if the circles of the \\textit{folding} are obtained by the intersection of $S$ with a family of parallel planes or with a family of planes containing a straight line $D$ exterior to $S$.
