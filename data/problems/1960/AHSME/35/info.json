{"answer": "C", "latex": "From point $P$ outside a circle, with a circumference of $10$ units, a tangent is drawn. Also from $P$ a secant is drawn dividing the circle into unequal arcs with lengths $m$ and $n$. It is found that $t_1$, the length of the tangent, is the mean proportional between $m$ and $n$. If $m$ and $t$ are integers, then $t$ may have the following number of values:\\\\\n\\\\\n$ \\textbf{(A)}\\ \\text{zero} \\qquad\\textbf{(B)}\\ \\text{one} \\qquad\\textbf{(C)}\\ \\text{two} \\qquad\\textbf{(D)}\\ \\text{three} \\qquad\\textbf{(E)}\\ \\text{infinitely many} $", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h550329p3193516", "category": ""}
