{"answer": "A", "latex": "You are given a sequence of $58$ terms; each term has the form $P+n$ where $P$ stands for the product $2 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times... \\times 61$ of all prime numbers less than or equal to $61$, and $n$ takes, successively, the values $2, 3, 4, ...., 59$. let $N$ be the number of primes appearing in this sequence. Then $N$ is:\\\\\n\\\\\n$ \\textbf{(A)}\\ 0\\qquad\\textbf{(B)}\\ 16\\qquad\\textbf{(C)}\\ 17\\qquad\\textbf{(D)}\\ 57\\qquad\\textbf{(E)}\\ 58 $", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h550324p3193484", "category": "N"}
