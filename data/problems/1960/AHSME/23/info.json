{"answer": "C", "latex": "The radius $R$ of a cylindrical box is $8$ inches, the height $H$ is $3$ inches. The volume $V = \\pi R^2H$ is to be increased by the same fixed positive amount when $R$ is increased by $x$ inches as when $H$ is increased by $x$ inches. This condition is satisfied by:\\\\\n\\\\\n$ \\textbf{(A)}\\ \\text{no real value of} \\text{ } x\\qquad$\\\\\n\\\\\n$\\textbf{(B)}\\ \\text{one integral value of} \\text{ } x\\qquad$\\\\\n\\\\\n$\\textbf{(C)}\\ \\text{one rational, but not integral, value of} \\text{ } x\\qquad$\\\\\n\\\\\n$\\textbf{(D)}\\ \\text{one irrational value of} \\text{ } x\\qquad$\\\\\n\\\\\n$\\textbf{(E)}\\ \\text{two real values of} \\text{ } x $", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h550311p3193399", "category": "A"}
