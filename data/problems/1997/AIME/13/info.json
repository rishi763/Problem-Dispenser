{"answer": "066", "latex": "Let $ S$ be the set of points in the Cartesian plane that satisfy\\\\\n\\[ \\Big|\\big|{|x| - 2}\\big| - 1\\Big| + \\Big|\\big|{|y| - 2}\\big| - 1\\Big| = 1.\n\\]\\\\\nIf a model of $ S$ were built from wire of negligible thickness, then the total length of wire required would be $ a\\sqrt {b},$ where $ a$ and $ b$ are positive integers and $ b$ is not divisible by the square of any prime number.  Find $ a + b.$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c6h66707p393657", "category": "A"}
