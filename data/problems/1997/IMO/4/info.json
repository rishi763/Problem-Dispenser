{"latex": "An $ n \\times n$ matrix whose entries come from the set $ S = \\{1, 2, \\ldots , 2n - 1\\}$ is called a \\textit{silver matrix} if, for each $ i = 1, 2, \\ldots , n$, the $ i$-th row and the $ i$-th column together contain all elements of $ S$. Show that:\\\\\n\\\\\n(a)  there is no silver matrix for $ n = 1997$;\\\\\n\\\\\n(b)  silver matrices exist for infinitely many values of $ n$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c6h176p611", "category": ""}
