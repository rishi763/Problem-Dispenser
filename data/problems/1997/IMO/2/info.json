{"latex": "It is known that $ \\angle BAC$ is the smallest angle in the triangle $ ABC$. The points $ B$ and $ C$ divide the circumcircle of the triangle into two arcs. Let $ U$ be an interior point of the arc between $ B$ and $ C$ which does not contain $ A$. The perpendicular bisectors of $ AB$ and $ AC$ meet the line $ AU$ at $ V$ and $ W$, respectively. The lines $ BV$ and $ CW$ meet at $ T$.\\\\\n\\\\\nShow that $ AU = TB + TC$.\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\textit{Alternative formulation:}\\\\\n\\\\\nFour different points $ A,B,C,D$ are chosen on a circle $ \\Gamma$ such that the triangle $ BCD$ is not right-angled. Prove that:\\\\\n\\\\\n(a) The perpendicular bisectors of $ AB$ and $ AC$ meet the line $ AD$ at certain points $ W$ and $ V,$ respectively, and that the lines $ CV$ and $ BW$ meet at a certain point $ T.$\\\\\n\\\\\n(b) The length of one of the line segments $ AD, BT,$ and $ CT$ is the sum of the lengths of the other two.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c6h58299p356701", "category": ""}
