{"answer": "E", "latex": "A list of integers has mode $ 32$ and mean $ 22$. The smallest number in the list is $ 10$. The median $ m$ of the list is a member of the list. If the list member $ m$ were replaced by $ m + 10$, the mean and median of the new list would be $ 24$ and $ m + 10$, respectively. If $ m$ were instead replaced by $ m - 8$, the median of the new list would be $ m - 4$. What is $ m$?\\\\\n\\\\\n$ \\textbf{(A)}\\ 16\\qquad \n\\textbf{(B)}\\ 17\\qquad \n\\textbf{(C)}\\ 18\\qquad \n\\textbf{(D)}\\ 19\\qquad \n\\textbf{(E)}\\ 20$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c4h252075p1379871", "category": ""}
