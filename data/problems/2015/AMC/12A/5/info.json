{"answer": "D", "latex": "Amelia needs to estimate the quantity $\\tfrac ab-c$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are large positive integers.  She rounds each of the integers so that the calculation will be easier to do mentally.  In which of these situations will her answer necessarily be greater than the exact value of $\\tfrac ab-c$?\\\\\n\\\\\n$\\textbf{(A) }\\text{She rounds all three numbers up.}$\\\\\n\\\\\n$\\textbf{(B) }\\text{She rounds }a\\text{ and }b\\text{ up, and she rounds }c\\text{ down.}$\\\\\n\\\\\n$\\textbf{(C) }\\text{She rounds }a\\text{ and }c\\text{ up, and she rounds }b\\text{ down.}$\\\\\n\\\\\n$\\textbf{(D) }\\text{She rounds }a\\text{ up, and she rounds }b\\text{ and }c\\text{ down.}$\\\\\n\\\\\n$\\textbf{(E) }\\text{She rounds }c\\text{ up, and she rounds }a\\text{ and }b\\text{ down.}$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h623908p3734676", "category": ""}
