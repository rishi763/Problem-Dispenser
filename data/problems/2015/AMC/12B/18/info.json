{"answer": "D", "latex": "For every composite positive integer $n$, define $r(n)$ to be the sum of the factors in the prime factorization of $n$. For example, $r(50)=12$ because the prime factorization of $50$ is $ 2 \\cdot 5^2 $, and $ 2 + 5 + 5 = 12 $. What is the range of the function $r$, $ \\{ r(n) : n \\ \\text{is a composite positive integer} \\} $?\\\\\n\\\\\n\\textbf{(A)} the set of positive integers\\\\\n\\textbf{(B)} the set of composite positive integers\\\\\n\\textbf{(C)} the set of even positive integers\\\\\n\\textbf{(D)} the set of integers greater than 3\\\\\n\\textbf{(E)} the set of integers greater than 4", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h626871p3760450", "category": ""}
