{"answer": "B", "latex": "A bee starts flying from point $P_0$. She flies 1 inch due east to point $P_1$. For $j \\ge 1$, once the bee reaches point $P_j$, she turns $30^{\\circ}$ counterclockwise and then flies $j+1$ inches straight to point $P_{j+1}$. When the bee reaches $P_{2015}$ she is exactly $a\\sqrt{b} + c\\sqrt{d}$ inches away from $P_0$, where $a$, $b$, $c$ and $d$ are positive integers and $b$ and $d$ are not divisible by the square of any prime. What is $a+b+c+d$?\\\\\n\\\\\n$ \\textbf{(A)}\\ 2016 \\qquad\\textbf{(B)}\\ 2024 \\qquad\\textbf{(C)}\\ 2032 \\qquad\\textbf{(D)}\\ 2040 \\qquad\\textbf{(E)}\\ 2048$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h626927p3760916", "category": ""}
