{"answer": "440", "latex": "Steve says to Jon, \"I am thinking of a polynomial whose roots are all positive integers. The polynomial has the form $P(x)=2x^3-2ax^2+(a^2-81)x-c$ for some positive integers $a$ and $c$. Can you tell me the values of $a$ and $c$?\"\\\\\n\\\\\nAfter some calculations, Jon says, \"There is more than one such polynomial.\"\\\\\n\\\\\nSteve says, \"You're right. Here is the value of $a$.\" He writes down a positive integer and asks, \"Can you tell me the value of $c$?\"\\\\\n\\\\\nJon says, \"There are still two possible values of $c$.\"\\\\\n\\\\\nFind the sum of the two possible values of $c$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h1070282p4652179", "category": "A"}
