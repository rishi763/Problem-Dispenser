{"answer": "036", "latex": "Let $a$ and $b$ be positive integers satisfying $\\frac{ab+1}{a+b}<\\frac{3}{2}$. The maximum possible value of $\\frac{a^3b^3+1}{a^3+b^3}$ is $\\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h1070285p4652196", "category": "A"}
