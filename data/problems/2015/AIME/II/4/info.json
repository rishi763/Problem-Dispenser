{"answer": "018", "latex": "In an isosceles trapezoid, the parallel bases have lengths $\\log3$ and $\\log192$, and the altitude to these bases has length $\\log16$. The perimeter of the trapezoid can be written in the form $\\log2^p3^q$, where $p$ and $q$ are positive integers. Find $p+q$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h1070277p4652169", "category": ""}
