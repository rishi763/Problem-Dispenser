{"answer": "161", "latex": "Triangle $ABC$ has side lengths $AB=12$, $BC=25$, and $CA=17$. Rectangle $PQRS$ has vertex $P$ on $\\overline{AB}$, vertex $Q$ on $\\overline{AC}$, and vertices $R$ and $S$ on $\\overline{BC}$. In terms of the side length $PQ=w$, the area of $PQRS$ can be expressed as the quadratic polynomial\\\\\n\\[\\text{Area}(PQRS)=\\alpha w-\\beta\\cdot w^2\\]\\\\\nThen the coefficient $\\beta=\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h1070283p4652185", "category": "G"}
