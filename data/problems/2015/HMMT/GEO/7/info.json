{"latex": "Let $ABCD$ be a square pyramid of height $\\frac{1}{2}$ with square base $ABCD$ of side length $AB=12$ (so $E$ is the vertex of the pyramid, and the foot of the altitude from $E$ to $ABCD$ is the center of square $ABCD$). The faces $ADE$ and $CDE$ meet at an acute angle of measure $\\alpha$ (so that $0^{\\circ}<\\alpha<90^{\\circ}$). Find $\\tan \\alpha$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c129h1358793p7440353", "category": ""}
