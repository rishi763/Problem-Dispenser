{"latex": "A given convex pentagon $ ABCDE$ has the property that the area of each of five triangles $ ABC, BCD, CDE, DEA$, and $ EAB$ is unity \\textit{(equal to 1)}. Show that all pentagons with the above property have the same area, and calculate that area. Show, furthermore, that there are infinitely many non-congruent pentagons having the above area property.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c6h336242p1798812", "category": "G"}
