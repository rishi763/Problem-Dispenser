{"latex": "We define a \\textit{chessboard polygon} to be a polygon whose sides are situated along lines of the form $ x = a$ or $ y = b$, where $ a$ and $ b$ are integers. These lines divide the interior into unit squares, which are shaded alternately grey and white so that adjacent squares have different colors. To tile a chessboard polygon by dominoes is to exactly cover the polygon by non-overlapping $ 1 \\times 2$ rectangles. Finally, a \\textit{tasteful tiling} is one which avoids the two configurations of dominoes shown on the left below. Two tilings of a $ 3 \\times 4$ rectangle are shown; the first one is tasteful, while the second is not, due to the vertical dominoes in the upper right corner.\\\\\n\\\\\n\n\\begin{asy}\nimport olympiad;\nimport cse5;\ndefaultpen(white);\nsize(100);\nsize(300); pathpen = linewidth(2.5);\nvoid chessboard(int a, int b, pair P){ \n for(int i = 0; i < a; ++i) for(int j = 0; j < b; ++j) \n  if((i+j) % 2 == 1) fill(shift(P.x+i,P.y+j)*unitsquare,rgb(0.6,0.6,0.6)); \n D(P--P+(a,0)--P+(a,b)--P+(0,b)--cycle);\n}\nchessboard(2,2,(2.5,0));fill(unitsquare,rgb(0.6,0.6,0.6));fill(shift(1,1)*unitsquare,rgb(0.6,0.6,0.6)); chessboard(4,3,(6,0)); chessboard(4,3,(11,0)); MP(\"\\mathrm{Distasteful\\ tilings}\",(2.25,3),fontsize(12)); \n\n/* draw lines */\nD((0,0)--(2,0)--(2,2)--(0,2)--cycle); D((1,0)--(1,2)); D((2.5,1)--(4.5,1)); D((7,0)--(7,2)--(6,2)--(10,2)--(9,2)--(9,0)--(9,1)--(7,1)); D((8,2)--(8,3)); D((12,0)--(12,2)--(11,2)--(13,2)); D((13,1)--(15,1)--(14,1)--(14,3)); D((13,0)--(13,3));\n\\end{asy}\n\\\\\n a) Prove that if a chessboard polygon can be tiled by dominoes, then it can be done so tastefully.\\\\\n\\\\\nb) Prove that such a tasteful tiling is unique.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h274393p1485321", "category": "C"}
