{"answer": "C", "latex": "Rachel and Robert run on a circular track. Rachel runs counterclockwise and completes a lap every $ 90$ seconds, and Robert runs clockwise and completes a lap every $ 80$ seconds. Both start from the start line at the same time. At some random time between $ 10$ minutes and $ 11$ minutes after they begin to run, a photographer standing inside the track takes a picture that shows one-fourth of the track, centered on the starting line. What is the probability that both Rachel and Robert are in the picture?\\\\\n\\\\\n$ \\textbf{(A)}\\ \\frac{1}{16}\\qquad \n\\textbf{(B)}\\ \\frac18\\qquad \n\\textbf{(C)}\\ \\frac{3}{16} \\qquad \n\\textbf{(D)}\\ \\frac14\\qquad \n\\textbf{(E)}\\ \\frac{5}{16}$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h261085p1419925", "category": "C"}
