{"latex": "A \\textit{kite} is a quadrilateral whose diagonals are perpendicular.  Let kite $ABCD$ be such that $\\angle B = \\angle D = 90^\\circ$.  Let $M$ and $N$ be the points of tangency of the incircle of $ABCD$ to $AB$ and $BC$ respectively.  Let $\\omega$ be the circle centered at $C$ and tangent to $AB$ and $AD$.  Construct another kite $AB^\\prime C^\\prime D^\\prime$ that is similar to $ABCD$ and whose incircle is $\\omega$.  Let $N^\\prime$ be the point of tangency of $B^\\prime C^\\prime$ to $\\omega$.  If $MN^\\prime \\parallel AC$, then what is the ratio of $AB:BC$?", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c129h485469p2719774", "category": ""}
