{"latex": "Points $A$ and $B$ lie on circle $\\omega$.  Point $P$ lies on the extension of segment $AB$ past $B$.  Line $\\ell$ passes through $P$ and is tangent to $\\omega$.  The tangents to $\\omega$ at points $A$ and $B$ intersect $\\ell$ at points $D$ and $C$ respectively.  Given that $AB=7$, $BC=2$, and $AD=3$, compute $BP$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c129h485476p2719785", "category": ""}
