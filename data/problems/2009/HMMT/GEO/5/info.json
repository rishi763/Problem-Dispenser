{"latex": "Circle $B$ has radius $6\\sqrt{7}$.  Circle $A$, centered at point $C$, has radius $\\sqrt{7}$ and is contained in $B$.  Let $L$ be the locus of centers $C$ such that there exists a point $D$ on the boundary of $B$ with the following property: if the tangents from $D$ to circle $A$ intersect circle $B$ again at $X$ and $Y$, then $XY$ is also tangent to $A$.  Find the area contained by the boundary of $L$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c129h485470p2719775", "category": ""}
