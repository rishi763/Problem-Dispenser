{"latex": "Given a rearrangement of the numbers from $1$ to $n$, each pair of consecutive elements $a$ and $b$ of the sequence can be either increasing (if $a < b$) or decreasing (if $b < a$). How many rearrangements of the numbers from $1$ to $n$ have exactly two increasing pairs of consecutive elements? Express your answer in terms of $n$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c129h456728p2565508", "category": ""}
