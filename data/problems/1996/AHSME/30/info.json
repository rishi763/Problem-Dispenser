{"answer": "E", "latex": "A hexagon inscribed in a circle has three consecutive sides each of length $3$ and three consecutive sides each of length $5$. The chord of the circle that divides the hexagon into two trapezoids, one with three sides each of length $3$ and the other with three sides each of length $5$, has length equal to $\\frac mn$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers.
