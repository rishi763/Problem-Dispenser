{"answer": "B", "latex": "Two opposite sides of a rectangle are each divided into $n$ congruent segments, and the endpoints of one segment are joined to the center to form triangle $A$. The other sides are each divided into $m$ congruent segments, and the endpoints of one of these segments are joined to the center to form triangle $B$. [See figure for $n = 5, m = 7$.]; What is the ratio of the area of triangle $A$ to the area of triangle $B$?\\\\\n\\\\\n\n\\begin{asy}\nimport olympiad;\nimport cse5;\ndefaultpen(white);\nsize(100);\n\nint i;\nfor(i=0; i<8; i=i+1) {\ndot((i,0)^^(i,5));\n}\nfor(i=1; i<5; i=i+1) {\ndot((0,i)^^(7,i));\n}\ndraw(origin--(7,0)--(7,5)--(0,5)--cycle, linewidth(0.8));\npair P=(3.5, 2.5);\ndraw((0,4)--P--(0,3)^^(2,0)--P--(3,0));\nlabel(\"$B$\", (2.3,0), NE);\nlabel(\"$A$\", (0,3.7), SE);\n\\end{asy}\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n$\\text{(A)} \\ 1 \\qquad \\text{(B)} \\ m/n \\qquad \\text{(C)} \\ n/m \\qquad \\text{(D)} \\ 2m/n \\qquad \\text{(E)} \\ 2n/m$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c4h64410p383178", "category": ""}
