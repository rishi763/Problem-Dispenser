{"answer": "E", "latex": "Circles $\\omega$ and $\\gamma$, both centered at $O$, have radii $20$ and $17$, respectively. Equilateral triangle $ABC$, whose interior lies in the interior of $\\omega$ but in the exterior of $\\gamma$, has vertex $A$ on $\\omega$, and the line containing side $\\overline{BC}$ is tangent to $\\gamma$. Segments $\\overline{AO}$ and $\\overline{BC}$ intersect at $P$, and $\\dfrac{BP}{CP} = 3$. Then $AB$ can be written in the form $\\dfrac{m}{\\sqrt{n}} - \\dfrac{p}{\\sqrt{q}}$ for positive integers $m$, $n$, $p$, $q$ with $\\gcd(m,n) = \\gcd(p,q) = 1$. What is $m+n+p+q$?\\\\\n$\\phantom{}$\\\\\n\\\\\n$\\textbf{(A) } 42 \\qquad \\textbf{(B) }86 \\qquad \\textbf{(C) } 92 \\qquad \\textbf{(D) } 114 \\qquad \\textbf{(E) } 130$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h1781192p11737079", "category": ""}
