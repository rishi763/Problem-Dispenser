{"latex": "Six unit disks $C_1$, $C_2$, $C_3$, $C_4$, $C_5$, $C_6$ are in the plane such that they don't intersect each other and $C_i$ is tangent to $C_{i+1}$ for $1 \\le i \\le 6$ (where $C_7 = C_1$). Let $C$ be the smallest circle that contains all six disks. Let $r$ be the smallest possible radius of $C$, and $R$ the largest possible radius. Find $R - r$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c129h1786302p11796069", "category": ""}
