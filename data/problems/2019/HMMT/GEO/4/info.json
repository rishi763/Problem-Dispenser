{"latex": "Convex hexagon $ABCDEF$ is drawn in the plane such that $ACDF$ and $ABDE$ are parallelograms with area 168. $AC$ and $BD$ intersect at $G$. Given that the area of $AGB$ is 10 more than the area of $CGB$, find the smallest possible area of hexagon $ABCDEF$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c129h1786300p11796065", "category": ""}
