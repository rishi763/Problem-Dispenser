{"latex": "Tessa the hyper-ant has a 2019-dimensional hypercube. For a real number $k$, she calls a placement of nonzero real numbers on the $2^{2019}$ vertices of the hypercube \textit{$k$-harmonic} if for any vertex, the sum of all 2019 numbers that are edge-adjacent to this vertex is equal to $k$ times the number on this vertex. Let $S$ be the set of all possible values of $k$ such that there exists a $k$-harmonic placement. Find $\\sum_{k \\in S} |k|$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c129h1786251p11795765", "category": ""}
