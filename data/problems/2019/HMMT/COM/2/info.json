{"latex": "Your math friend Steven rolls five fair icosahedral dice (each of which is labelled $1,2, \\dots,20$ on its sides). He conceals the results but tells you that at least half the rolls are $20$. Suspicious, you examine the first two dice and find that they show $20$ and $19$ in that order. Assuming that Steven is truthful, what is the probability that all three remaining concealed dice show $20$?", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c129h1786276p11795956", "category": ""}
