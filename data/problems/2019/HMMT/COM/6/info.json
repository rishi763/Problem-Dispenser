{"latex": "A point $P$ lies at the center of square $ABCD$. A sequence of points $\\{P_n\\}$ is determined by $P_0 = P$, and given point $P_i$, point $P_{i+1}$ is obtained by reflecting $P_i$ over one of the four lines $AB$, $BC$, $CD$, $DA$, chosen uniformly at random and independently for each $i$. What is the probability that $P_8 = P$?", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c129h1786288p11796030", "category": ""}
