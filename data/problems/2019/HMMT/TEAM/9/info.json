{"latex": "Let $p > 2$ be a prime number. $\\mathbb{F}_p[x]$ is defined as the set of polynomials in $x$ with coefficients in $\\mathbb{F}_p$ (the integers modulo $p$ with usual addition and subtraction), so that two polynomials are equal if and only if the coefficients of $x^k$ are equal in $\\mathbb{F}_p$ for each nonnegative integer $k$. For example, $(x+2)(2x+3) = 2x^2 + 2x + 1$ in $\\mathbb{F}_5[x]$ because the corresponding coefficients are equal modulo 5.\\\\\n\\\\\nLet $f, g \\in \\mathbb{F}_p[x]$. The pair $(f, g)$ is called \\textit{compositional} if\\\\\n\\[f(g(x)) \\equiv x^{p^2} - x\\]in $\\mathbb{F}_p[x]$.
