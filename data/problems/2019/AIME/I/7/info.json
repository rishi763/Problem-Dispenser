{"answer": "880", "latex": "There are positive integers $x$ and $y$ that satisfy the system of equations\\\\\n\\begin{align*}\n\\log_{10} x + 2 \\log_{10} (\\gcd(x,y)) &= 60 \\\\ \\log_{10} y + 2 \\log_{10} (\\text{lcm}(x,y)) &= 570.\n\\end{align*}Let $m$ be the number of (not necessarily distinct) prime factors in the prime factorization of $x$, and let $n$ be the number of (not necessarily distinct) prime factors in the prime factorization of $y$. Find $3m+2n$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h1802338p11972709", "category": "N"}
