{"answer": "216", "latex": "In a Martian civilization, all logarithms whose bases are not specified are assumed to be base $b$, for some fixed $b \\geq 2$. A Martian student writes down\\\\\n\\begin{align*}3 \\log(\\sqrt{x}\\log x) &= 56\\\\\\log_{\\log (x)}(x) &= 54\n\\end{align*}and finds that this system of equations has a single real number solution $x > 1$. Find $b$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h1807894p12030324", "category": "A"}
