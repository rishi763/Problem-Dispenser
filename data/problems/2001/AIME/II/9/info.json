{"answer": "929", "latex": "Each unit square of a 3-by-3 unit-square grid is to be colored either blue or red. For each square, either color is equally likely to be used. The probability of obtaining a grid that does not have a 2-by-2 red square is $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c4h125990p714304", "category": "C"}
