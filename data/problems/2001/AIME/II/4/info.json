{"answer": "067", "latex": "Let $R=(8,6)$. The lines whose equations are $8y=15x$ and $10y=3x$ contain points $P$ and $Q$, respectively, such that $R$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{PQ}$. The length of $PQ$ equals $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c4h125983p714296", "category": "G"}
