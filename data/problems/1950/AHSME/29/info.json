{"answer": "B", "latex": "A manufacturer built a machine which will address $500$ envelopes in $8$ minutes. He wishes to build another machine so that when both are operating together they will address $500$ envelopes in $2$ minutes. The equation used to find how many minutes $x$ it would require the second machine to address $500$ envelopes alone is:\\\\\n\\\\\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ 8-x=2 \\qquad\n\\textbf{(B)}\\ \\dfrac{1}{8}+\\dfrac{1}{x}=\\dfrac{1}{2} \\qquad\n\\textbf{(C)}\\ \\dfrac{500}{8}+\\dfrac{500}{x}=500 \\qquad\n\\textbf{(D)}\\ \\dfrac{x}{2}+\\dfrac{x}{8}=1 \\qquad\\\\\n\\textbf{(E)}\\ \\text{None of these answers}$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c4h216027p1195787", "category": "A"}
