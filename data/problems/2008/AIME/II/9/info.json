{"answer": "019", "latex": "A particle is located on the coordinate plane at $ (5,0)$. Define a \\textit{move} for the particle as a counterclockwise rotation of $ \\pi/4$ radians about the origin followed by a translation of $ 10$ units in the positive $ x$-direction. Given that the particle's position after $ 150$ moves is $ (p,q)$, find the greatest integer less than or equal to $ |p|+|q|$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h197927p1088469", "category": "A"}
