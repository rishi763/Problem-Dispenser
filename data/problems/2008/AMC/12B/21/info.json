{"answer": "E", "latex": "Two circles of radius 1 are to be constructed as follows. The center of circle $ A$ is chosen uniformly and at random from the line segment joining $ (0,0)$ and $ (2,0)$. The center of circle $ B$ is chosen uniformly and at random, and independently of the first choice, from the line segment joining $ (0,1)$ to $ (2,1)$. What is the probability that circles $ A$ and $ B$ intersect?\\\\\n\\\\\n$ \\textbf{(A)} \\; \\frac{2+\\sqrt{2}}{4} \\qquad \\textbf{(B)} \\; \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}+2}{8} \\qquad \\textbf{(C)} \\; \\frac{2 \\sqrt{2} - 1}{2} \\qquad \\textbf{(D)} \\; \\frac{2+\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\qquad \\textbf{(E)} \\; \\frac{4 \\sqrt{3} - 3}{4}$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h191387p1051111", "category": ""}
