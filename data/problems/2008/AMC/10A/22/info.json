{"answer": "D", "latex": "Jacob uses the following procedure to write down a sequence of numbers. First he chooses the first term to be $ 6$. To generate each succeeding term, he flips a fair coin. If it comes up heads, he doubles the previous term and subtracts $ 1$. If it comes up tails, he takes half of the previous term and subtracts $ 1$. What is the probability that the fourth term in Jacob's sequence is an integer?\\\\\n\\\\\n$ \\textbf{(A)}\\ \\frac{1}{6} \\qquad\n\\textbf{(B)}\\ \\frac{1}{3} \\qquad\n\\textbf{(C)}\\ \\frac{1}{2} \\qquad\n\\textbf{(D)}\\ \\frac{5}{8} \\qquad\n\\textbf{(E)}\\ \\frac{3}{4}$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h190231p1044676", "category": "C"}
