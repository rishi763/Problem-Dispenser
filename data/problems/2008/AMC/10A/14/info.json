{"answer": "D", "latex": "Older television screens have an aspect ratio of $ 4: 3$. That is, the ratio of the width to the height is $ 4: 3$. The aspect ratio of many movies is not $ 4: 3$, so they are sometimes shown on a television screen by 'letterboxing' - darkening strips of equal height at the top and bottom of the screen, as shown. Suppose a movie has an aspect ratio of $ 2: 1$ and is shown on an older television screen with a $ 27$-inch diagonal. What is the height, in inches, of each darkened strip?\\\\\n\n\\begin{asy}\nimport olympiad;\nimport cse5;\ndefaultpen(white);\nsize(100);\nunitsize(1mm);\ndefaultpen(linewidth(.8pt));\nfilldraw((0,0)--(21.6,0)--(21.6,2.7)--(0,2.7)--cycle,grey,black);\nfilldraw((0,13.5)--(21.6,13.5)--(21.6,16.2)--(0,16.2)--cycle,grey,black);\ndraw((0,2.7)--(0,13.5));\ndraw((21.6,2.7)--(21.6,13.5));\n\\end{asy}\n\\\\\n$ \\textbf{(A)}\\ 2 \\qquad \\textbf{(B)}\\ 2.25 \\qquad \\textbf{(C)}\\ 2.5 \\qquad \\textbf{(D)}\\ 2.7 \\qquad \\textbf{(E)}\\ 3$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h189159p1038381", "category": ""}
