{"latex": "Let $ ABC$ be an equilateral triangle with side length 2, and let $ \\Gamma$ be a circle with radius $ \\frac {1}{2}$ centered at the center of the equilateral triangle. Determine the length of the shortest path that starts somewhere on $ \\Gamma$, visits all three sides of $ ABC$, and ends somewhere on $ \\Gamma$ (not necessarily at the starting point). Express your answer in the form of $ \\sqrt p - q$, where $ p$ and $ q$ are rational numbers written as reduced fractions.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c4h192983p1059144", "category": ""}
