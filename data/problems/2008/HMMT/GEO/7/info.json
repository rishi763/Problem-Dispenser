{"latex": "Let $ C_1$ and $ C_2$ be externally tangent circles with radius 2 and 3, respectively. Let $ C_3$ be a circle internally tangent to both $ C_1$ and $ C_2$ at points $ A$ and $ B$, respectively. The tangents to $ C_3$ at $ A$ and $ B$ meet at $ T$, and $ TA = 4$. Determine the radius of $ C_3$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c4h192982p1059138", "category": ""}
