{"latex": "Let $ S = \\{1,2,\\ldots,2008\\}$. For any nonempty subset $ A\\in S$, define $ m(A)$ to be the median of $ A$ (when $ A$ has an even number of elements, $ m(A)$ is the average of the middle two elements). Determine the average of $ m(A)$, when $ A$ is taken over all nonempty subsets of $ S$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c4h191867p1053521", "category": ""}
