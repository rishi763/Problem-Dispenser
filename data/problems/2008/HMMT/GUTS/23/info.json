{"latex": "Two mathematicians, Kelly and Jason, play a cooperative game. The computer selects some secret positive integer $ n < 60$ (both Kelly and Jason know that $ n < 60$, but that they don't know what the value of $ n$ is). The computer tells Kelly the unit digit of $ n$, and it tells Jason the number of divisors of $ n$. Then, Kelly and Jason have the following dialogue:\\\\\n\\\\\nKelly: I don't know what $ n$ is, and I'm sure that you don't know either. However, I know that $ n$ is divisible by at least two different primes.\\\\\n\\\\\nJason: Oh, then I know what the value of $ n$ is.\\\\\n\\\\\nKelly: Now I also know what $ n$ is.\\\\\n\\\\\nAssuming that both Kelly and Jason speak truthfully and to the best of their knowledge, what are all the possible values of $ n$?", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c4h198876p1093495", "category": ""}
