{"latex": "Let $ P$ be a polyhedron where every face is a regular polygon, and every edge has length $ 1$. Each vertex of $ P$ is incident to two regular hexagons and one square. Choose a vertex $ V$ of the polyhedron. Find the volume of the set of all points contained in $ P$ that are closer to $ V$ than to any other vertex.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c6h204733p1127173", "category": ""}
