{"latex": "Let $ \\mathcal{C}$ be the hyperbola $ y^2 - x^2 = 1$.  Given a point $ P_0$ on the $ x$-axis, we construct a sequence of points $ (P_n)$ on the $ x$-axis in the following manner: let $ \\ell_n$ be the line with slope $ 1$ passing passing through $ P_n$, then $ P_{n+1}$ is the orthogonal projection of the point of intersection of $ \\ell_n$ and $ \\mathcal C$ onto the $ x$-axis. (If $ P_n = 0$, then the sequence simply terminates.)\\\\\n\\\\\nLet $ N$ be the number of starting positions $ P_0$ on the $ x$-axis such that $ P_0 = P_{2008}$. Determine the remainder of $ N$ when divided by $ 2008$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c6h204736p1127176", "category": ""}
