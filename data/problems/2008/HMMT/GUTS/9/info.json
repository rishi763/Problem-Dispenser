{"latex": "Consider a circular cone with vertex $ V$, and let $ ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in the base of the cone, such that $ AB$ is a diameter and $ AC = BC$. Let $ L$ be a point on $ BV$ such that the volume of the cone is 4 times the volume of the tetrahedron $ ABCL$. Find the value of $ BL/LV$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c4h195846p1076107", "category": ""}
