{"latex": "Let $ \\mathcal P$ be a parabola, and let $ V_1$ and $ F_1$ be its vertex and focus, respectively. Let $ A$ and $ B$ be points on $ \\mathcal P$ so that $ \\angle AV_1 B = 90^\\circ$. Let $ \\mathcal Q$ be the locus of the midpoint of $ AB$. It turns out that $ \\mathcal Q$ is also a parabola, and let $ V_2$ and $ F_2$ denote its vertex and focus, respectively. Determine the ratio $ F_1F_2/V_1V_2$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c4h199700p1098184", "category": ""}
