{"latex": "Suppose we have an (infinite) cone $ \\mathcal C$ with apex $ A$ and a plane $ \\pi$. The intersection of $ \\pi$ and $ \\mathcal C$ is an ellipse $ \\mathcal E$ with major axis $ BC$, such that $ B$ is closer to $ A$ than $ C$, and $ BC = 4$, $ AC = 5$, $ AB = 3$. Suppose we inscribe a sphere in each part of $ \\mathcal C$ cut up by $ \\mathcal E$ with both spheres tangent to $ \\mathcal E$. What is the ratio of the radii of the spheres (smaller to larger)?", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c4h195850p1076119", "category": ""}
