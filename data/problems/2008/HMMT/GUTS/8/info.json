{"latex": "Trodgor the dragon is burning down a village consisting of $ 90$ cottages.  At time $ t = 0$ an angry peasant arises from each cottage, and every $ 8$ minutes ($ 480$ seconds) thereafter another angry peasant spontaneously generates from each non-burned cottage.  It takes Trodgor $ 5$ seconds to either burn a peasant or to burn a cottage, but Trodgor cannot begin burning cottages until all the peasants around him have been burned. How many \\textbf{seconds} does it take Trodgor to burn down the entire village?", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c4h195844p1076101", "category": ""}
