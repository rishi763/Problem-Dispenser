{"answer": "041", "latex": "Three concentric circles have radii $3$, $4$, and $5$.  An equilateral triangle with one vertex on each circle has side length $s$.  The largest possible area of the triangle can be written as $a+\\frac{b}{c}\\sqrt{d}$, where $a,b,c$ and $d$ are positive integers, $b$ and $c$ are relatively prime, and $d$ is not divisible by the square of any prime.  Find $a+b+c+d$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h469916p2630571", "category": ""}
