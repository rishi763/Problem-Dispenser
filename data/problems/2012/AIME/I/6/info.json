{"answer": "071", "latex": "The complex numbers $z$ and $w$ satisfy $z^{13} = w$, $w^{11} = z$, and the imaginary part of $z$ is $\\sin\\left(\\frac{m\\pi}n\\right)$ for relatively prime positive integers $m$ and $n$ with $m < n$. Find $n$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h469886p2630386", "category": ""}
