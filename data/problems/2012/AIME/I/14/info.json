{"answer": "375", "latex": "Complex numbers $a$, $b$ and $c$ are the zeros of a polynomial $P(z) = z^3+qz+r$, and $|a|^2+|b|^2+|c|^2=250$.  The points corresponding to $a$, $b$, and $c$ in the complex plane are the vertices of a right triangle with hypotenuse $h$.  Find $h^2$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h469917p2630575", "category": ""}
