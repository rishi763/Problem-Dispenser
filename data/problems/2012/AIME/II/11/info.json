{"answer": "008", "latex": "Let $f_1(x) = \\frac{2}{3}-\\frac{3}{3x+1}$, and for $n \\ge 2$, define $f_n(x) = f_1(f_{n-1} (x))$. The value of x that satisfies $f_{1001}(x) = x - 3$ can be expressed in the form $\\frac{m}{n}$,\\\\\nwhere $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m + n$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h472296p2644164", "category": ""}
