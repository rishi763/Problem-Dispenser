{"answer": "750", "latex": "In the accompanying figure, the outer square has side length 40. A second square S' of side length 15 is constructed inside S with the same center as S and with sides parallel to those of S. From each midpoint of a side of S, segments are drawn to the two closest vertices of S'. The result is a four-pointed starlike figure inscribed in S. The star figure is cut out and then folded to form a pyramid with base S'. Find the volume of this pyramid.\\\\\n\n\\begin{asy}\nimport olympiad;\nimport cse5;\ndefaultpen(white);\nsize(100);\n\ndraw((0,0)--(8,0)--(8,8)--(0,8)--(0,0));\ndraw((2.5,2.5)--(4,0)--(5.5,2.5)--(8,4)--(5.5,5.5)--(4,8)--(2.5,5.5)--(0,4)--(2.5,2.5)--(5.5,2.5)--(5.5,5.5)--(2.5,5.5)--(2.5,2.5));\n\n\\end{asy}\n\\\\\n", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h472278p2644099", "category": ""}
