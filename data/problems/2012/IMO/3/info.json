{"latex": "The \\textit{liar's guessing game} is a game played between two players $A$ and $B$. The rules of the game depend on two positive integers $k$ and $n$ which are known to both players.\\\\\n\\\\\nAt the start of the game $A$ chooses integers $x$ and $N$ with $1 \\le x \\le N.$ Player $A$ keeps $x$ secret, and truthfully tells $N$ to player $B$. Player $B$ now tries to obtain information about $x$ by asking player $A$ questions as follows: each question consists of $B$ specifying an arbitrary set $S$ of positive integers (possibly one specified in some previous question), and asking $A$ whether $x$ belongs to $S$. Player $B$ may ask as many questions as he wishes. After each question, player $A$ must immediately answer it with \\textit{yes} or \\textit{no}, but is allowed to lie as many times as she wants; the only restriction is that, among any $k+1$ consecutive answers, at least one answer must be truthful.\\\\\n\\\\\nAfter $B$ has asked as many questions as he wants, he must specify a set $X$ of at most $n$ positive integers. If $x$ belongs to $X$, then $B$ wins; otherwise, he loses. Prove that:\\\\\n\\\\\n1. If $n \\ge 2^k,$ then $B$ can guarantee a win.\\\\\n2. For all sufficiently large $k$, there exists an integer $n \\ge (1.99)^k$ such that $B$ cannot guarantee a win.\\\\\n\\\\\n\\textit{Proposed by David Arthur, Canada}", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c6h488351p2736406", "category": ""}
