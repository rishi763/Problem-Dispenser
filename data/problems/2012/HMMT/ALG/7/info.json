{"latex": "Let $\\otimes$ be a binary operation that takes two positive real numbers and returns a positive real number.  Suppose further that $\\otimes$ is continuous, commutative $(a\\otimes b=b\\otimes a)$, distributive across multiplication $(a\\otimes(bc)=(a\\otimes b)(a\\otimes c))$, and that $2\\otimes 2=4$.  Solve the equation $x\\otimes y=x$ for $y$ in terms of $x$ for $x>1$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c129h521065p2934966", "category": ""}
