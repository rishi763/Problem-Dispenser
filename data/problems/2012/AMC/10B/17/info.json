{"answer": "C", "latex": "Jesse cuts a circular paper disk of radius $12$ along two radii to form two sectors, the smaller having a central angle of $120$ degrees. He makes two circular cones, using each sector to form the lateral surface of a cone. What is the ratio of the volume of the smaller cone to that of the larger?\\\\\n\\\\\n$ \\textbf{(A)}\\ \\frac{1}{8} \\qquad\\textbf{(B)}\\ \\frac{1}{4} \\qquad\\textbf{(C)}\\ \\frac{\\sqrt{10}}{10} \\qquad\\textbf{(D)}\\ \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{6} \\qquad\\textbf{(E)}\\ \\frac{\\sqrt{10}}{5} $", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h465870p2608872", "category": "G"}
