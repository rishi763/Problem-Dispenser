{"answer": "A", "latex": "A $3\\times3$ square is partitioned into $9$ unit squares.  Each unit square is painted either white or black with each color being equally likely, chosen independently and at random.  The square is the rotated $90^\\circ$ clockwise about its center, and every white square in a position formerly occupied by a black square is painted black.  The colors of all other squares are left unchanged.  What is the probability that the grid is now entirely black?\\\\\n\\\\\n$ \\textbf{(A)}\\ \\dfrac{49}{512}\n\\qquad\\textbf{(B)}\\ \\dfrac{7}{64}\n\\qquad\\textbf{(C)}\\ \\dfrac{121}{1024}\n\\qquad\\textbf{(D)}\\ \\dfrac{81}{512}\n\\qquad\\textbf{(E)}\\ \\dfrac{9}{32}\n $", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h462721p2594748", "category": ""}
