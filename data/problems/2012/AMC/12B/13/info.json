{"answer": "D", "latex": "Two parabolas have equations $y=x^2+ax+b$ and $y=x^2+cx+d$, where $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are integers (not necessarily different), each chosen independently by rolling a fair six-sided die.  What is the probability that the parabolas have at least one point in common?\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ \\frac{1}{2} \\qquad\\textbf{(B)}\\ \\frac{25}{36} \\qquad\\textbf{(C)}\\ \\frac{5}{6} \\qquad\\textbf{(D)}\\ \\frac{31}{36} \\qquad\\textbf{(E)}\\ 1 $", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h465887p2609056", "category": ""}
