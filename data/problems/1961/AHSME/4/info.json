{"answer": "B", "latex": "Let the set consisting of the squares of the positive integers be called $u$; thus $u$ is the set $1, 4, 9, 16 . . .$. If a certain operation on one or more members of the set always yields a member of the set, we say that the set is closed under that operation. Then $u$ is closed under:\\\\\n\\\\\n${{ \\textbf{(A)}\\ \\text{Addition}\\qquad\\textbf{(B)}\\ \\text{Multiplication} \\qquad\\textbf{(C)}\\ \\text{Division} \\qquad\\textbf{(D)}\\ \\text{Extraction of a positive integral root} }\\qquad\\textbf{(E)} \\text{None of these} } $", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h495793p2783806", "category": "N"}
