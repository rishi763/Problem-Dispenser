{"answer": "A", "latex": "Let $S$ be the set of values assumed by the fraction \\[\\frac{2x+3}{x+2}\\] when $x$ is any member of the interval $x \\ge 0$. If there exists a number $M$ such that no number of the set $S$ is greater than $M$, then $M$ is an upper bound of $S$. If there exists a number $m$ such that such that no number of the set $S$ is less than $m$, then $m$ is a lower bound of $S$. We may then say:\\\\\n\\\\\n$ \\textbf{(A)}\\ \\text{m is in S, but M is not in S} $\\\\\n$\\textbf{(B)}\\ \\text{M is in S, but m is not in S}$\\\\\n$\\textbf{(C)}\\ \\text{Both m and M are in S} $\\\\\n$\\textbf{(D)}\\ \\text{Neither m nor M are in S}$\\\\\n$\\textbf{(E)}\\ \\text{M does not exist either in or outside S} $", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h496031p2785317", "category": "A"}
