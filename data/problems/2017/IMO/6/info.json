{"latex": "An ordered pair $(x, y)$ of integers is a primitive point if the greatest common divisor of $x$ and $y$ is $1$. Given a finite set $S$ of primitive points, prove that there exist a positive integer $n$ and integers $a_0, a_1, \\ldots , a_n$ such that, for each $(x, y)$ in $S$, we have:\\\\\n$$a_0x^n + a_1x^{n-1} y + a_2x^{n-2}y^2 + \\cdots + a_{n-1}xy^{n-1} + a_ny^n = 1.$$\\\\\n\\textit{Proposed by John Berman, United States}", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c6h1480686p8639242", "category": ""}
