{"answer": "D", "latex": "A set $S$ is constructed as follows. To begin, $S=\\{0,10\\}$. Repeatedly, as long as possible, if $x$ is an integer root of some polynomial $a_nx^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\\cdots+a_1x+a_0$ for some $n\\geq 1$, all of whose coefficients $a_i$ are elements of $S$, then $x$ is put into $S$. When no more elements can be added to $S$, how many elements does $S$ have?\\\\\n\\\\\n$\\textbf{(A) } 4 \\qquad \\textbf{(B) } 5 \\qquad \\textbf{(C) } 7 \\qquad \\textbf{(D) } 9 \\qquad \\textbf{(E) } 11$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h1379732p7643072", "category": ""}
