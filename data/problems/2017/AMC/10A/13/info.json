{"answer": "D", "latex": "Define a sequence recursively by $F_0 = 0$, $F_1 = 1$, and $F_n = $ the remainder when $F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$ is divided by $3$, for all $n \\ge 2$. Thus the sequence starts $0,1,1,2,0,2 \\ldots$. What is $F_{2017} + F_{2018} + F_{2019} + F_{2020} + F_{2021} + F_{2022} + F_{2023} + F_{2024}$?\\\\\n\\\\\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ 6\\qquad\\textbf{(B)}\\ 7\\qquad\\textbf{(C)}\\ 8\\qquad\\textbf{(D)}\\ 9\\qquad\\textbf{(E)}\\ 10$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h1379694p7642665", "category": "N"}
