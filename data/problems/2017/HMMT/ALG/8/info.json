{"latex": "Consider all ordered pairs of integers $(a,b)$ such that $1\\le a\\le b\\le 100$ and $$\\frac{(a+b)(a+b+1)}{ab}$$is an integer.\\\\\n\\\\\nAmong these pairs, find the one with largest value of $b$. If multiple pairs have this maximal value of $b$, choose the one with largest $a$. For example choose $(3,85)$ over $(2,85)$ over $(4,84)$. Note that your answer should be an ordered pair.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c129h1386264p7710461", "category": ""}
