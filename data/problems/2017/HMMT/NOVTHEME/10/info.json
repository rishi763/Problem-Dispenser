{"latex": "\\textbf{D}enote $\\phi=\\frac{\\sqrt{5}+1}{2}$ and consider the set of all finite binary strings without leading zeroes. Each string $S$ has a \"base-$\\phi$\" value $p(S)$. For example, $p(1101)=\\phi^3+\\phi^2+1$. For any positive integer n, let $f(n)$ be the number of such strings S that satisfy $p(S) =\\frac{\\phi^{48n}-1}{\\phi^{48}-1}$. The sequence of fractions $\\frac{f(n+1)}{f(n)}$ approaches a real number $c$ as $n$ goes to infinity. Determine the value of $c$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c129h1640164p10330916", "category": ""}
