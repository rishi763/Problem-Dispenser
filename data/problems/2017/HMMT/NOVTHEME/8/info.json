{"latex": "\\textbf{U}ndecillion years ago in a galaxy far, far away, there were four space stations in the three-dimensional space, each pair spaced 1 light year away from each other. Admiral Ackbar wanted to establish a base somewhere in space such that the sum of squares of the distances from the base to each of the stations does not exceed 15 square light years. (The sizes of the space stations and the base are negligible.) Determine the volume, in cubic light years, of the set of all possible locations for the Admiral's base.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c129h1640156p10330873", "category": ""}
