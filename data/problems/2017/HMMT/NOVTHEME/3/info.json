{"latex": "\\textbf{E}milia wishes to create a basic solution with 7% hydroxide (OH) ions. She has three solutions of different bases available: 10% rubidium hydroxide (Rb(OH)), 8% cesium hydroxide (Cs(OH)), and 5% francium hydroxide (Fr(OH)). (The Rb(OH) solution has both 10% Rb ions and 10% OH ions, and similar for the other solutions.) Since francium is highly radioactive, its concentration in the final solution should not exceed 2%. What is the highest possible concentration of rubidium in her solution?", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c129h1640125p10330497", "category": ""}
