{"latex": "\\textbf{N}ew this year at HMNT: the exciting game of RNG baseball! In RNG baseball, a team of infinitely many people play on a square field, with a base at each vertex; in particular, one of the bases is called the home base. Every turn, a new player stands at home base and chooses a number n uniformly at random from $\\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. Then, the following occurs:\\\\\n$\\bullet$ If $n>0$, then the player and everyone else currently on the field moves (counterclockwise) around\\\\\nthe square by n bases. However, if in doing so a player returns to or moves past the home base,\\\\\nhe/she leaves the field immediately and the team scores one point.\\\\\n$\\bullet$ If $n=0$ (a strikeout), then the game ends immediately; the team does not score any more points.\\\\\nWhat is the expected number of points that a given team will score in this game?", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c129h1640161p10330898", "category": ""}
