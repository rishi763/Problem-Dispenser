{"latex": "\\textbf{R}thea, a distant planet, is home to creatures whose DNA consists of two (distinguishable) strands of bases with a fixed orientation. Each base is one of the letters H, M, N, T, and each strand consists of a sequence of five bases, thus forming five pairs. Due to the chemical properties of the bases, each pair must consist of distinct bases. Also, the bases H and M cannot appear next to each other on the same strand; the same is true for N and T. How many possible DNA sequences are there on Rthea?", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c129h1640140p10330636", "category": ""}
