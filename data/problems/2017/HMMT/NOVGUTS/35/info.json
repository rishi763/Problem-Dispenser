{"latex": "Welcome to the \\textbf{USAYNO}, where each question has a yes/no answer. Choose any subset of the following six problems to answer. If you answer $n$ problems and get them \\textbf{all} correct, you will receive $\\max(0, (n-1)(n-2))$ points. If any of them are wrong (or you leave them all blank), you will receive $0$ points.\\\\\n\\\\\nYour answer should be a six-character string containing 'Y' (for yes), 'N' (for no), or 'B' (for blank). For instance if you think 1, 2, and 6 are 'yes' and 3 and 4 are 'no', you should answer YYNNBY (and receive $12$ points if all five answers are correct, 0 points if any are wrong).\\\\\n\\\\\n(a) Does there exist a finite set of points, not all collinear, such that a line between any two points in the set passes through a third point in the set?\\\\\n\\\\\n(b) Let $ABC$ be a triangle and $P$ be a point. The \\textit{isogonal conjugate} of $P$ is the intersection of the reflection of line $AP$ over the $A$-angle bisector, the reflection of line $BP$ over the $B$-angle bisector, and the reflection of line $CP$ over the $C$-angle bisector. Clearly the incenter is its own isogonal conjugate. Does there exist another point that is its own isogonal conjugate?\\\\\n\\\\\n(c) Let $F$ be a convex figure in a plane, and let $P$ be the largest pentagon that can be inscribed in $F$. Is it necessarily true that the area of $P$ is at least $\\frac{3}{4}$ the area of $F$?\\\\\n\\\\\n(d) Is it possible to cut an equilateral triangle into $2017$ pieces, and rearrange the pieces into a square?\\\\\n\\\\\n(e) Let $ABC$ be an acute triangle and $P$ be a point in its interior. Let $D,E,F$ lie on $BC, CA, AB$ respectively so that $PD$ bisects $\\angle{BPC}$, $PE$ bisects $\\angle{CPA}$, and $PF$ bisects $\\angle{APB}$. Is it necessarily true that $AP+BP+CP\\ge 2(PD+PE+PF)$?\\\\\n\\\\\n(f) Let $P_{2018}$ be the surface area of the $2018$-dimensional unit sphere, and let $P_{2017}$ be the surface area of the $2017$-dimensional unit sphere. Is $P_{2018}>P_{2017}$?\\\\\n\\\\\n<span style=\"color:red\">The USAYNO disclaimer is only included in problem 33.
