{"latex": "Welcome to the \\textbf{USAYNO}, where each question has a yes/no answer. Choose any subset of the following six problems to answer. If you answer $n$ problems and get them \\textbf{all} correct, you will receive $\\max(0, (n-1)(n-2))$ points. If any of them are wrong (or you leave them all blank), you will receive $0$ points.\\\\\n\\\\\nYour answer should be a six-character string containing 'Y' (for yes), 'N' (for no), or 'B' (for blank). For instance if you think 1, 2, and 6 are 'yes' and 3 and 4 are 'no', you should answer YYNNBY (and receive $12$ points if all five answers are correct, 0 points if any are wrong).\\\\\n\\\\\n(a) $a,b,c,d,A,B,C,$ and $D$ are positive real numbers such that $\\frac{a}{b} > \\frac{A}{B}$ and $\\frac{c}{d} > \\frac{C}{D}$. Is it necessarily true that $\\frac{a+c}{b+d} > \\frac{A+C}{B+D}$?\\\\\n\\\\\n(b) Do there exist irrational numbers $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ such that the sequence $\\lfloor\\alpha\\rfloor+\\lfloor\\beta\\rfloor, \\lfloor2\\alpha\\rfloor+\\lfloor2\\beta\\rfloor, \\lfloor3\\alpha\\rfloor+\\lfloor3\\beta\\rfloor, \\dots$ is arithmetic?\\\\\n\\\\\n(c) For any set of primes $\\mathbb{P}$, let $S_\\mathbb{P}$ denote the set of integers whose prime divisors all lie in $\\mathbb{P}$. For instance $S_{\\{2,3\\}}=\\{2^a3^b \\; | \\; a,b\\ge 0\\}=\\{1,2,3,4,6,8,9,12,\\dots\\}$. Does there exist a finite set of primes $\\mathbb{P}$ and integer polynomials $P$ and $Q$ such that $\\gcd(P(x), Q(y))\\in S_\\mathbb{P}$ for all $x,y$?\\\\\n\\\\\n(d) A function $f$ is called \\textbf{P-recursive} if there exists a positive integer $m$ and real polynomials $p_0(n), p_1(n), \\dots, p_m(n)$<span style=\"color:red\">, not all zero, satisfying\\\\\n\\[p_m(n)f(n+m)=p_{m-1}(n)f(n+m-1)+\\dots+p_0(n)f(n)\\]for all $n$. Does there exist a P-recursive function $f$ satisfying $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\frac{f(n)}{n^{\\sqrt{2}}}=1$?\\\\\n\\\\\n(e) Does there exist a \\textbf{nonpolynomial} function $f: \\mathbb{Z}\\to\\mathbb{Z}$ such that $a-b$ divides $f(a)-f(b)$ for all integers $a\\neq b$?\\\\\n\\\\\n(f) Do there exist periodic functions $f, g:\\mathbb{R}\\to\\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(x)+g(x)=x$ for all $x$?\\\\\n\\\\\n<span style=\"color:red\">A clarification was issued for problem 33(d) during the test.
