{"latex": "Welcome to the \\textbf{USAYNO}, where each question has a yes/no answer. Choose any subset of the following six problems to answer. If you answer $n$ problems and get them \\textbf{all} correct, you will receive $\\max(0, (n-1)(n-2))$ points. If any of them are wrong (or you leave them all blank), you will receive $0$ points.\\\\\n\\\\\nYour answer should be a six-character string containing 'Y' (for yes), 'N' (for no), or 'B' (for blank). For instance if you think 1, 2, and 6 are 'yes' and 3 and 4 are 'no', you should answer YYNNBY (and receive $12$ points if all five answers are correct, 0 points if any are wrong).\\\\\n\\\\\n(a) Does $\\sum_{i=1}^{p-1}\\frac{1}{i}\\equiv 0\\pmod{p^2}$ for all odd prime numbers $p$? (Note that $\\frac{1}{i}$ denotes the number such that $i\\cdot\\frac{1}{i}\\equiv 1\\pmod{p^2}$)\\\\\n\\\\\n(b) Do there exist $2017$ positive perfect cubes that sum to a perfect cube?\\\\\n\\\\\n(c) Does there exist a right triangle with rational side lengths and area $5$?\\\\\n\\\\\n(d) A \\textit{magic square} is a $3\\times 3$ grid of numbers, all of whose rows, columns, and major diagonals sum to the same value. Does there exist a magic square whose entries are all <span style=\"color:red\">different prime numbers?\\\\\n\\\\\n(e) Is $\\prod_{p} \\frac{p^2+1}{p^2-1} = \\frac{2^2+1}{2^2-1}\\cdot\\frac{3^2+1}{3^2-1}\\cdot\\frac{5^2+1}{5^2-1}\\cdot\\frac{7^2+1}{7^2-1}\\cdot\\dots$ a rational number?\\\\\n\\\\\n(f) Do there exist infinite number of pairs of \\textit{distinct} integers $(a,b)$ such that $a$ and $b$ have the same set of prime divisors, and $a+1$ and $b+1$ have the same set of prime divisors?\\\\\n\\\\\n<span style=\"color:red\">The USAYNO disclaimer is only included in problem 33.
