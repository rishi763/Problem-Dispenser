{"latex": "Find (in terms of $n \\ge 1$) the number of terms with odd coefficients after expanding the product:\\\\\n\\[\\prod_{1 \\le i < j \\le n} (x_i + x_j)\\]e.g., for $n = 3$ the expanded product is given by $x_1^2 x_2 + x_1^2 x_3 + x_2^2 x_3 + x_2^2 x_1 + x_3^2 x_1 + x_3^2 x_2 + 2x_1 x_2 x_3$ and so the answer would be $6$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c129h1387213p7718359", "category": ""}
