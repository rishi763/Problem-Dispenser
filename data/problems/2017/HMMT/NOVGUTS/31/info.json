{"latex": "A baseball league has $6$ teams. To decide the schedule for the league, for each pair of teams, a coin is flipped. If it lands head, they will play a game this season, in which one team wins and one team loses. If it lands tails, they don't play a game that season. Define the \\textit{imbalance} of this schedule to be the minimum number of teams that will end up undefeated, i.e. lose $0$ games. Find the expected value of the imbalance in this league.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c129h1387227p7718392", "category": ""}
