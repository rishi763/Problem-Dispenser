{"latex": "Consider an equilateral triangular grid $G$ with $20$ points on a side, where each row consists of points spaced $1$ unit apart. More specifically, there is a single point in the first row, two points in the second row, ..., and $20$ points in the last row, for a total of $210$ points. Let $S$ be a closed non-self-intersecting polygon which has $210$ vertices, using each point in $G$ exactly once. Find the sum of all possible values of the area of $S$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c129h1387226p7718390", "category": ""}
