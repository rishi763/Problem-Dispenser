{"latex": "At a recent math contest, Evan was asked to find $2^{2016} \\pmod{p}$ for a given prime number $p$ with $100 < p < 500$. Evan has forgotten what the prime $p$ was, but still remembers how he solved it:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Evan first tried taking $2016$ modulo $p - 1$, but got a value $e$ larger than $100$.\n\\item However, Evan noted that $e - \\frac{1}{2}(p - 1) = 21$, and then realized the answer was $-2^{21} \\pmod{p}$.\n\\end{itemize}\nWhat was the prime $p$?", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c129h1387219p7718375", "category": ""}
