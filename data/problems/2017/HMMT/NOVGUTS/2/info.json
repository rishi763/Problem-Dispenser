{"latex": "Let $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, $E$, $F$ be $6$ points on a circle in that order. Let $X$ be the intersection of $AD$ and $BE$, $Y$ is the intersection of $AD$ and $CF$, and $Z$ is the intersection of $CF$ and $BE$. $X$ lies on segments $BZ$ and $AY$ and $Y$ lies on segment $CZ$. Given that $AX = 3$, $BX = 2$, $CY = 4$, $DY = 10$, $EZ = 16$, and $FZ = 12$, find the perimeter of triangle $XYZ$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c129h1387195p7718300", "category": ""}
