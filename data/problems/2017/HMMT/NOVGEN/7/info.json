{"latex": "Reimu has a wooden cube. In each step, she creates a new polyhedron from the previous one by cutting off a pyramid from each vertex of the polyhedron along a plane through the trisection point on each adjacent edge that is closer to the vertex. For example, the polyhedron after the first step has six octagonal faces and eight equilateral triangular faces. How many faces are on the polyhedron after the fifth step?", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c129h1639935p10329294", "category": ""}
