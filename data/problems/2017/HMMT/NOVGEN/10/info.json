{"latex": "Five equally skilled tennis players named Allen, Bob, Catheryn, David, and Evan play in a round robin tournament, such that each pair of people play exactly once, and there are no ties. In each of the ten games, the two players both have a 50% chance of winning, and the results of the games are independent. Compute the probability that there exist four distinct players $P_1$, $P_2$, $P_3$, $P_4$ such that $P_i$ beats $P_{i+1}$ for $i=1, 2, 3, 4$. (We denote $P_5=P_1$).", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c129h1639967p10329429", "category": ""}
