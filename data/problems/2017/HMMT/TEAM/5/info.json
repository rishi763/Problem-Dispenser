{"latex": "Let $ABC$ be an acute triangle. The altitudes $BE$ and $CF$ intersect at the orthocenter $H$, and point $O$ denotes the circumcenter. Point $P$ is chosen so that $\\angle APH = \\angle OPE = 90^{\\circ}$, and point $Q$ is chosen so that $\\angle AQH = \\angle OQF = 90^{\\circ}$. Lines $EP$ and $FQ$ meet at point $T$. Prove that points $A$, $T$, $O$ are collinear.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c129h1385985p7707901", "category": ""}
