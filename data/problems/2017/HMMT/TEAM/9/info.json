{"latex": "Let $n$ be an odd positive integer greater than $2$, and consider a regular $n$-gon $\\mathcal{G}$ in the plane centered at the origin. Let a \\textit{subpolygon} $\\mathcal{G}'$ be a polygon with at least $3$ vertices whose vertex set is a subset of that of $\\mathcal{G}$. Say $\\mathcal{G}'$ is \\textit{well-centered} if its centroid is the origin. Also, say $\\mathcal{G}'$ is \\textit{decomposable} if its vertex set can be written as the disjoint union of regular polygons with at least $3$ vertices. Show that all well-centered subpolygons are decomposable if and only if $n$ has at most two distinct prime divisors.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c129h1385989p7707912", "category": ""}
