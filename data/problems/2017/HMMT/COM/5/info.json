{"latex": "Kelvin the Frog likes numbers whose digits strictly decrease, but numbers that violate this condition in at most one place are good enough. In other words, if $d_i$ denotes the $i$th digit, then $d_i\\le d_{i+1}$ for at most one value of $i$. For example, Kelvin likes the numbers $43210$, $132$, and $3$, but not the numbers $1337$ and $123$. How many $5$-digit numbers does Kelvin like?", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c129h1386289p7710663", "category": ""}
