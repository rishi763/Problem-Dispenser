{"latex": "Kelvin and $15$ other frogs are in a meeting, for a total of $16$ frogs. During the meeting, each pair of distinct frogs becomes friends with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$. Kelvin thinks the situation after the meeting is \\textit{cool} if for each of the $16$ frogs, the number of friends they made during the meeting is a multiple of $4$. Say that the probability of the situation being cool can be expressed in the form $\\frac{a}{b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime. Find $a$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c129h1386296p7710730", "category": ""}
