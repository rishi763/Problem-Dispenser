{"latex": "Emily starts with an empty bucket. Every second, she either adds a stone to the bucket or removes a stone from the bucket, each with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$. If she wants to remove a stone from the bucket and the bucket is currently empty, she merely does nothing for that second (still with probability $\\hfill \\frac{1}{2}$). What is the probability that after $2017$ seconds her bucket contains exactly $1337$ stones?", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c129h1386293p7710698", "category": ""}
