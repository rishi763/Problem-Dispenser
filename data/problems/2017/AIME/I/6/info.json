{"answer": "048", "latex": "A circle is circumscribed around an isosceles triangle whose two congruent angles have degree measure $x$. Two points are chosen independently and uniformly at random on the circle, and a chord is drawn between them. The probability that the chord intersects the triangle is $\\frac{14}{25}$. Find the difference between the largest and smallest possible values of $x$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h1397890p7812797", "category": ""}
