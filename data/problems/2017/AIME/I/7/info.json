{"answer": "564", "latex": "For nonnegative integers $a$ and $b$ with  $a + b \\leq 6$, let $T(a, b) = \\binom{6}{a} \\binom{6}{b} \\binom{6}{a + b}$. Let $S$ denote the sum of all $T(a, b)$, where $a$ and $b$ are nonnegative integers with $a + b \\leq 6$. Find the remainder when $S$ is divided by $1000$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h1397891p7812801", "category": ""}
