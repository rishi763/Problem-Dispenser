{"answer": "110", "latex": "Circle $C_0$ has radius $1$, and the point $A_0$ is a point on the circle. Circle $C_1$ has radius $r<1$ and is internally tangent to $C_0$ at point $A_0$. Point $A_1$ lies on circle $C_1$ so that $A_1$ is located $90^{\\circ}$ counterclockwise from $A_0$ on $C_1$. Circle $C_2$ has radius $r^2$ and is internally tangent to $C_1$ at point $A_1$. In this way a sequence of circles $C_1,C_2,C_3,...$ and a sequence of points on the circles $A_1,A_2,A_3,...$ are constructed, where circle $C_n$ has radius $r^n$ and is internally tangent to circle $C_{n-1}$ at point $A_{n-1}$, and point $A_n$ lies on $C_n$ $90^{\\circ}$ counterclockwise from point $A_{n-1}$, as shown in the figure below. There is one point $B$ inside all of these circles. When $r=\\frac{11}{60}$, the distance from the center of $C_0$ to $B$ is $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.\\\\\n\\\\\n\n\\begin{asy}\nimport olympiad;\nimport cse5;\ndefaultpen(white);\nsize(100);\n\nsize(6cm);\nreal r = 0.8;\n\npair nthCircCent(int n){\npair ans = (0, 0);\nfor(int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)\nans += rotate(90 * i - 90) * (r^(i - 1) - r^i, 0);\nreturn ans;\n}\n\nvoid dNthCirc(int n){\ndraw(circle(nthCircCent(n), r^n));\n}\n\ndNthCirc(0);\ndNthCirc(1);\ndNthCirc(2);\ndNthCirc(3);\n\ndot(\"$A_0$\", (1, 0), dir(0));\ndot(\"$A_1$\", nthCircCent(1) + (0, r), dir(135));\ndot(\"$A_2$\", nthCircCent(2) + (-r^2, 0), dir(0));\n\n\\end{asy}\n\\\\\n", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h1409438p7910350", "category": ""}
