{"answer": "682", "latex": "Tetrahedron $ABCD$ has $AD=BC=28$, $AC=BD=44$, and $AB=CD=52$. For any point $X$ in space, define $f(X)=AX+BX+CX+DX$. The least possible value of $f(X)$ can be expressed as $m\\sqrt{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h1409444p7910363", "category": "G"}
