{"answer": "245", "latex": "For each integer $n\\ge 3$, let $f(n)$ be the number of 3-element subsets of the vertices of a regular $n$-gon that are the vertices of an isosceles triangle (including equilateral triangles). Find the sum of all values of $n$ such that $f(n+1)=f(n)+78$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h1409440p7910357", "category": ""}
