{"answer": "E", "latex": "Given distinct straight lines $ OA$ and $ OB$.  From a point in $ OA$ a perpendicular is drawn to $ OB$; from the foot of this perpendicular a line is drawn perpendicular to $ OA$.  From the foot of this second perpendicular a line is drawn perpendicular to $ OB$; and so on indefinitely.  The lengths of the first and second perpendiculars are $ a$ and $ b$, respectively.  Then the sum of the lengths of the perpendiculars approaches a limit as the number of perpendiculars grows beyond all bounds.  This limit is:\\\\\n\\\\\n$ \\textbf{(A)}\\ \\frac {b}{a - b} \\qquad \\textbf{(B)}\\ \\frac {a}{a - b} \\qquad \\textbf{(C)}\\ \\frac {ab}{a - b} \\qquad \\textbf{(D)}\\ \\frac {b^2}{a - b} \\qquad \\textbf{(E)}\\ \\frac {a^2}{a - b}$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c4h250678p1373173", "category": ""}
