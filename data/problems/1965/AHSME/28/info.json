Two boys, $ A$ and $ Z$, walk down the escalator steadily as it moves, $ A$ negotiating twice as many escalator steps per minute as $ Z$.  $ A$ reaches the bottom after taking $ 27$ steps while $ Z$ reaches the bottom after taking $ 18$ steps.  Then $ n$ is:\\\\\n\\\\\n$ \\textbf{(A)}\\ 63 \\qquad \\textbf{(B)}\\ 54 \\qquad \\textbf{(C)}\\ 45 \\qquad \\textbf{(D)}\\ 36 \\qquad \\textbf{(E)}\\ 30$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c4h250663p1373141", "category": ""}
