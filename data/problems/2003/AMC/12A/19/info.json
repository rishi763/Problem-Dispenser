{"answer": "D", "latex": "A parabola with equation $ y = ax^2 + bx + c$ is reflected about the $ x$-axis. The parabola and its reflection are translated horizontally five units in opposite directions to become the graphs of $ y = f(x)$ and $ y = g(x)$, respectively. Which of the following describes the graph of $ y = (f + g)(x)$?\\\\\n\\\\\n$ \\textbf{(A)}\\ \\text{a parabola tangent to the }x\\text{ - axis}$\\\\\n$ \\textbf{(B)}\\ \\text{a parabola not tangent to the }x\\text{ - axis} \\qquad \\textbf{(C)}\\ \\text{a horizontal line}$\\\\\n$ \\textbf{(D)}\\ \\text{a non - horizontal line} \\qquad \\textbf{(E)}\\ \\text{the graph of a cubic function}$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c4h189654p1041589", "category": ""}
