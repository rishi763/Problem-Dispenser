{"answer": "B", "latex": "Let $M$ be the midpoint of side $AB$ of the triangle $ABC$.  Let$P$ be a point on $AB$ between $A$ and $M$, and let $MD$ be drawn parallel to $PC$ and intersecting $BC$ at $D$.  If the ratio of the area of the triangle $BPD$ to that of triangle $ABC$ is denoted by $r$, then\\\\\n\\\\\n$\\text{(A)}\\ \\tfrac{1}{2}<r<1\\text{ depending upon the position of }P \\qquad\\\\\n\\text{(B)}\\ r=\\tfrac{1}{2}\\text{ independent of the position of }P\\qquad\\\\\n\\text{(C)}\\ \\tfrac{1}{2}\\le r<1\\text{ depending upon the position of }P \\qquad\\\\\n\\text{(D)}\\ \\tfrac{1}{3}<r<\\tfrac{2}{3}\\text{ depending upon the position of }P \\qquad\\\\\n\\text{(E)}\\ r=\\tfrac{1}{3} \\text{ independent of the position of }P$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h427565p2421488", "category": "G"}
