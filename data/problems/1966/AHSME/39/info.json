{"answer": "E", "latex": "In base $R_1$ the expanded fraction $F_1$ becomes $0.373737...$, and the expanded fraction $F_2$ becomes $0.737373...$.  In base $R_2$ fraction $F_1$, when expanded, becomes $0.252525...$, while fraction $F_2$ becomes $0.525252...$.  The sum of $R_1$ and $R_2$, each written in base ten is:\\\\\n\\\\\n$\\text{(A)}\\ 24 \\qquad\n\\text{(B)}\\ 22\\qquad\n\\text{(C)}\\ 21\\qquad\n\\text{(D)}\\ 20\\qquad\n\\text{(E)}\\ 19$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h427579p2421548", "category": "A"}
