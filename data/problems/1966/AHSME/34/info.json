{"answer": "B", "latex": "Let $r$ be the speed in miles per hour at which a wheel, $11$ feet in circumference, travels.  If the time for a complete rotation of the wheel is shortened by $\\tfrac{1}{4}$ of a second, the speed $r$ is increased by $5$ miles per hour.  The $r$ is:\\\\\n\\\\\n$\\text{(A)}\\ 9\\qquad\n\\text{(B)}\\ 10\\qquad\n\\text{(C)}\\ 10\\tfrac{1}{2}\\qquad\n\\text{(D)}\\ 11\\qquad\n\\text{(E)}\\ 12$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h427568p2421513", "category": "A"}
