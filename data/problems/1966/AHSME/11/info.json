{"answer": "C", "latex": "The sides of triangle $BAC$ are in the ratio $2: 3: 4$. $BD$ is the angle-bisector drawn to the shortest side $AC$, dividing it into segments $AD$ and $CD$. If the length of $AC$ is $10$, then the length of the longer segment of $AC$ is:\\\\\n\\\\\n$\\text{(A)} \\ 3\\frac12 \\qquad \\text{(B)} \\ 5 \\qquad \\text{(C)} \\ 5\\frac57 \\qquad \\text{(D)} \\ 6 \\qquad \\text{(E)} \\ 7\\frac12$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c4h80381p460043", "category": "G"}
