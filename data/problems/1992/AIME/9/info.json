{"answer": "164", "latex": "Trapezoid $ABCD$ has sides $AB=92$, $BC=50$, $CD=19$, and $AD=70$, with $AB$ parallel to $CD$. A circle with center $P$ on $AB$ is drawn tangent to $BC$ and $AD$. Given that $AP=\\frac mn$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers, find $m+n$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c4h74681p430595", "category": "G"}
