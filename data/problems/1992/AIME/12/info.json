{"answer": "792", "latex": "In a game of \\textit{Chomp}, two players alternately take bites from a 5-by-7 grid of unit squares. To take a bite, a player chooses one of the remaining squares, then removes (\"eats'') all squares in the quadrant defined by the left edge (extended upward) and the lower edge (extended rightward) of the chosen square. For example, the bite determined by the shaded square in the diagram would remove the shaded square and the four squares marked by $\\times.$ (The squares with two or more dotted edges have been removed form the original board in previous moves.)\\\\\n\\\\\n\n\\begin{asy}\nimport olympiad;\nimport cse5;\ndefaultpen(white);\nsize(100);\n\ndefaultpen(linewidth(0.7));\nfill((2,2)--(2,3)--(3,3)--(3,2)--cycle, mediumgray);\nint[] array={5, 5, 5, 4, 2, 2, 2, 0};\npair[] ex = {(2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3)};\ndraw((3,5)--(7,5)^^(4,4)--(7,4)^^(4,3)--(7,3), linetype(\"3 3\"));\ndraw((4,4)--(4,5)^^(5,2)--(5,5)^^(6,2)--(6,5)^^(7,2)--(7,5), linetype(\"3 3\"));\nint i, j;\nfor(i=0; i<7; i=i+1) {\nfor(j=0; j<array[i]; j=j+1) {\ndraw((i,j+1)--(i,j)--(i+1,j));\n}\ndraw((i,array[i])--(i+1,array[i]));\nif(array[i]>array[i+1]) {\ndraw((i+1,array[i])--(i+1,array[i+1]));\n}}\nfor(i=0; i<4; i=i+1) {\ndraw(ex[i]--(ex[i].x+1, ex[i].y+1), linewidth(1.2));\ndraw((ex[i].x+1, ex[i].y)--(ex[i].x, ex[i].y+1), linewidth(1.2));\n}\n\\end{asy}\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nThe object of the game is to make one's opponent take the last bite.
