{"answer": "D", "latex": "For each vertex of a solid cube, consider the tetrahedron determined by the vertex and the midpoints of the three edges that meet at that vertex.  The portion of the cube that remains when these eight tetrahedra are cut away is called a \\textit{cuboctahedron}.  The ratio of the volume of the cuboctahedron to the volume of the original cube is closest to which of these?\\\\\n\\\\\n$ \\textbf{(A)}\\ 75\\%\\qquad\\textbf{(B)}\\ 78\\%\\qquad\\textbf{(C)}\\ 81\\%\\qquad\\textbf{(D)}\\ 84\\%\\qquad\\textbf{(E)}\\ 87\\% $", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h445415p2507492", "category": "G"}
