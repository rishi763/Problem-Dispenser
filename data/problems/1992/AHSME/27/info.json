{"answer": "D", "latex": "A circle of radius $r$ has chords $\\overline{AB}$ of length $10$ and $\\overline{CD}$ of length $7$.  When $\\overline{AB}$ and $\\overline{CD}$ are extended through $B$ and $C$, respectively, they intersect at $P$, which is outside the circle.  If $\\angle APD = 60^{\\circ}$ and $BP = 8$, then $r^{2} =$\\\\\n\\\\\n$ \\textbf{(A)}\\ 70\\qquad\\textbf{(B)}\\ 71\\qquad\\textbf{(C)}\\ 72\\qquad\\textbf{(D)}\\ 73\\qquad\\textbf{(E)}\\ 74 $", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h449638p2529892", "category": "G"}
