{"answer": "E", "latex": "Let $f$ be a function defined on the set of positive rational numbers with the property that $f(a\\cdot b)=f(a)+f(b)$ for all positive rational numbers $a$ and $b$. Suppose that $f$ also has the property that $f(p)=p$ for every prime number $p$. For which of the following numbers $x$ is $f(x)<0?$\\\\\n\\\\\n$\\textbf{(A) } \\frac{17}{32} \\qquad \\textbf{(B) } \\frac{11}{16} \\qquad \\textbf{(C) } \\frac{7}{9} \\qquad \\textbf{(D) } \\frac{7}{6} \\qquad \\textbf{(E) } \\frac{25}{11}$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h2440228p20215515", "category": ""}
