{"answer": "C", "latex": "Values for $A,B,C,$ and $D$ are to be selected from $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$ without replacement (i.e. no two letters have the same value). How many ways are there to make such choices so that the two curves $y=Ax^2+B$ and $y=Cx^2+D$ intersect? (The order in which the curves are listed does not matter; for example, the choices $A=3, B=2, C=4, D=1$ is considered the same as the choices $A=4, B=1, C=3, D=2.$)\\\\\n\\\\\n$\\textbf{(A) }30 \\qquad \\textbf{(B) }60 \\qquad \\textbf{(C) }90 \\qquad \\textbf{(D) }180 \\qquad \\textbf{(E) }360$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h2440359p20216649", "category": ""}
