{"answer": "C", "latex": "Let $ABCDEF$ be an equiangular hexagon. The lines $AB, CD,$ and $EF$ determine a triangle with area $192\\sqrt{3}$, and the lines $BC, DE,$ and $FA$ determine a triangle with area $324\\sqrt{3}$. The perimeter of hexagon $ABCDEF$ can be expressed as $m + n\\sqrt{p}$, where $m, n,$ and $p$ are positive integers and $p$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. What is $m + n + p$?\\\\\n\\\\\n$\\textbf{(A)} 47\\qquad\\textbf{(B)} 52\\qquad\\textbf{(C)} 55\\qquad\\textbf{(D)} 58\\qquad\\textbf{(E)} 63$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h2440234p20215542", "category": ""}
