{"answer": "E", "latex": "Let $S$ be the set of lattice points in the coordinate plane, both of whose coordinates are integers between $1$ and $30,$ inclusive. Exactly $300$ points in $S$ lie on or below a line with equation $y=mx.$ The possible values of $m$ lie in an interval of length $\\frac ab,$ where $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime positive integers.
