{"answer": "A", "latex": "Three balls are randomly and independently tossed into bins numbered with the positive integers so that for each ball, the probability it is tossed into bin $i$ is $2^{-i}$ for $i = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots$. More than one ball is allowed in each bin. The probability that the balls end up evenly spaced in distinct bins is $\\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. (For example, the balls are evenly spaced if they are tossed into bins $3$, $17$, and $10$.) What is $p+q$?\\\\\n\\\\\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ 55 \\qquad\\textbf{(B)}\\ 56 \\qquad\\textbf{(C)}\\ 57 \\qquad\\textbf{(D)}\\ 58 \\qquad\\textbf{(E)}\\ 59$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h2447804p20334145", "category": ""}
