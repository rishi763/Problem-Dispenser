{"answer": "B", "latex": "Arjun and Beth play a game in which they take turns removing one brick or two adjacent bricks from one \"wall\" among a set of several walls of bricks, with gaps possibly creating new walls. The walls are one brick tall. For example, a set of walls of sizes $4$ and $2$ can be changed into any of the following by one move: $(3,2),(2,1,2),(4),(4,1),(2,2),$ or $(1,1,2).$\\\\\n\\\\\n\n\\begin{asy}\nimport olympiad;\nimport cse5;\ndefaultpen(white);\nsize(100);\n\nunitsize(4mm); real[] boxes = {0,1,2,3,5,6,13,14,15,17,18,21,22,24,26,27,30,31,32,33}; for(real i:boxes){ \tdraw(box((i,0),(i+1,3))); } draw((8,1.5)--(12,1.5),Arrow()); defaultpen(fontsize(20pt)); label(\",\",(20,0)); label(\",\",(29,0)); label(\",...\",(35.5,0));\n\n\\end{asy}\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nArjun plays first, and the player who removes the last brick wins.
