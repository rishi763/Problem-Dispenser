{"answer": "D", "latex": "Suppose that $S$ is a finite set of positive integers. If the greatest integer in $S$ is removed from $S$, then the average value (arithmetic mean) of the integers remaining is $32$. If the least integer is $S$ is \\textit{also} removed, then the average value of the integers remaining is $35$. If the greatest integer is then returned to the set, the average value of the integers rises to $40$. The greatest integer in the original set $S$ is $72$ greater than the least integer in $S$. What is the average value of all the integers in the set $S$?\\\\\n\\\\\n$\\textbf{(A)} ~36.2 \\qquad\\textbf{(B)} ~36.4 \\qquad\\textbf{(C)} ~36.6 \\qquad\\textbf{(D)} ~36.8 \\qquad\\textbf{(E)} ~37$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h2447831p20334295", "category": ""}
