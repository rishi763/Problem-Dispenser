Each of the people randomly and independently of the other two people places one of their blocks into each box. The probability that at least one box receives $3$ blocks all of the same color is $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m + n ?$\\\\\n\\\\\n$\\textbf{(A)} ~47 \\qquad\\textbf{(B)} ~94 \\qquad\\textbf{(C)} ~227 \\qquad\\textbf{(D)} ~471 \\qquad\\textbf{(E)} ~542$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h2447535p20329350", "category": ""}
