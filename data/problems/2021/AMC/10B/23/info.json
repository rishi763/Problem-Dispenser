{"answer": "C", "latex": "A square with side length $8$ is colored white except for $4$ black isosceles right triangular regions with legs of length $2$ in each corner of the square and a black diamond with side length $2\\sqrt{2}$ in the center of the square, as shown in the diagram. A circular coin with diameter $1$ is dropped onto the square and lands in a random location where the coin is completely contained within the square, The probability that the coin will cover part of the black region of the square can be written as $\\frac{1}{196}(a+b\\sqrt{2}+\\pi)$, where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers. What is $a+b$?\\\\\n\\\\\n\n\\begin{asy}\nimport olympiad;\nimport cse5;\ndefaultpen(white);\nsize(100);\n \n//Diagram by Samrocksnature\ndraw((0,0)--(8,0)--(8,8)--(0,8)--(0,0));\nfill((2,0)--(0,2)--(0,0)--cycle, black);\nfill((6,0)--(8,0)--(8,2)--cycle, black);\nfill((8,6)--(8,8)--(6,8)--cycle, black);\nfill((0,6)--(2,8)--(0,8)--cycle, black);\nfill((4,6)--(2,4)--(4,2)--(6,4)--cycle, black);\nfilldraw(circle((2.6,3.31),0.47),gray);\n\n\n\\end{asy}\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n$\\textbf{(A) }64 \\qquad \\textbf{(B) }66 \\qquad \\textbf{(C) }68 \\qquad \\textbf{(D) }70 \\qquad \\textbf{(E) }72$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h2447911p20334833", "category": ""}
