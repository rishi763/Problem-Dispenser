{"answer": "A", "latex": "The five solutions to the equation $$(z-1)(z^2+2z+4)(z^2+4z+6)=0$$may be written in the form $x_k+y_ki$ for $1\\le k\\le 5,$ where $x_k$ and $y_k$ are real. Let $\\mathcal E$ be the unique ellipse that passes through the points $(x_1,y_1),(x_2,y_2),(x_3,y_3),(x_4,y_4),$ and $(x_5,y_5)$. The eccentricity of $\\mathcal E$ can be written in the form $\\sqrt{\\frac mn}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$? (Recall that the \\textit{eccentricity} of an ellipse $\\mathcal E$ is the ratio $\\frac ca$, where $2a$ is the length of the major axis of $E$ and $2c$ is the is the distence between its two foci.)\\\\\n\\\\\n$\\textbf{(A) }7 \\qquad \\textbf{(B) }9 \\qquad \\textbf{(C) }11 \\qquad \\textbf{(D) }13\\qquad \\textbf{(E) }15$\\\\\n\\\\\nProposed by \\textbf{djmathman}", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h2440249p20215610", "category": "A"}
