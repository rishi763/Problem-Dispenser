{"answer": "335", "latex": "Two spheres with radii $36$ and one sphere with radius $13$ are each externally tangent to the other two spheres and to two different planes $\\mathcal{P}$ and $\\mathcal{Q}$. The intersection of planes $\\mathcal{P}$ and $\\mathcal{Q}$ is the line $\\ell$. The distance from line $\\ell$ to the point where the sphere with radius $13$ is tangent to plane $\\mathcal{P}$ is $\\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m + n$.\\\\\n\\\\\nhttps://imgur.com/1mfBNNL.png", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h2495168p21026619", "category": ""}
