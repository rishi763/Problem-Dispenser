{"answer": "047", "latex": "A convex quadrilateral has area $30$ and side lengths $5, 6, 9,$ and $7,$ in that order. Denote by $\\theta$ the measure of the acute angle formed by the diagonals of the quadrilateral. Then $\\tan \\theta$ can be written in the form $\\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m + n$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h2495173p21026659", "category": ""}
