{"answer": "330", "latex": "There are real numbers $a, b, c, $ and $d$ such that $-20$ is a root of $x^3 + ax + b$ and $-21$ is a root of $x^3 + cx^2 + d.$ These two polynomials share a complex root $m + \\sqrt{n} \\cdot i, $ where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers and $i = \\sqrt{-1}.$ Find $m+n.$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h2495182p21026751", "category": ""}
