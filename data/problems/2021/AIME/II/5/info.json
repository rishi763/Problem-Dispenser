{"answer": "736", "latex": "For positive real numbers $s$, let $\\tau(s)$ denote the set of all obtuse triangles that have area $s$ and two sides with lengths $4$ and $10$. The set of all $s$ for which $\\tau(s)$ is nonempty, but all triangles in $\\tau(s)$ are congruent, is an interval $[a,b)$. Find $a^2+b^2$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h2495178p21026709", "category": ""}
