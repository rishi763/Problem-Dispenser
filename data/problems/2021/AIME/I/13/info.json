{"answer": "672", "latex": "Circles $\\omega_1$ and $\\omega_2$ with radii $961$ and $625$, respectively, intersect at distinct points $A$ and $B$. A third circle $\\omega$ is externally tangent to both $\\omega_1$ and $\\omega_2$. Suppose line $AB$ intersects $\\omega$ at two points $P$ and $Q$ such that the measure of minor arc $\\widehat{PQ}$ is $120^{\\circ}$. Find the distance between the centers of $\\omega_1$ and $\\omega_2$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h2484038p20872596", "category": "G"}
