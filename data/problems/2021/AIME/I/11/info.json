{"answer": "301", "latex": "Let $ABCD$ be a cyclic quadrilateral with $AB=4,BC=5,CD=6,$ and $DA=7$. Let $A_1$ and $C_1$ be the feet of the perpendiculars from $A$ and $C$, respectively, to line $BD,$ and let $B_1$ and $D_1$ be the feet of the perpendiculars from $B$ and $D,$ respectively, to line $AC$. The perimeter of $A_1B_1C_1D_1$ is $\\frac mn$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h2484040p20872614", "category": ""}
