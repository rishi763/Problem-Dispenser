{"answer": "285", "latex": "Let $S$ be the set of positive integers $k$ such that the two parabolas$$y=x^2-k~~\\text{and}~~x=2(y-20)^2-k$$intersect in four distinct points, and these four points lie on a circle with radius at most $21$. Find the sum of the least element of $S$ and the greatest element of $S$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h2484051p20872801", "category": "A"}
