{"answer": "097", "latex": "Zou and Chou are practicing their 100-meter sprints by running $6$ races against each other. Zou wins the first race, and after that, the probability that one of them wins a race is $\\frac23$ if they won the previous race but only $\\frac13$ if they lost the previous race. The probability that Zou will win exactly $5$ of the $6$ races is $\\frac mn$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h2484019p20872455", "category": "C"}
