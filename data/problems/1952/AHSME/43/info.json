{"answer": "A", "latex": "The diameter of a circle is divided into $ n$ equal parts. On each part a semicircle is construced. As $ n$ becomes very large, the sum of the lengths of the arcs of the semicircles approaches a length:\\\\\n\\\\\n$ \\textbf{(A)}$ equal to the semi-circumference of the original circle\\\\\n$ \\textbf{(B)}$ equal to the diameter of the original circle\\\\\n$ \\textbf{(C)}$ greater than the diameter but less than the semi-circumeference of the original circle\\\\\n$ \\textbf{(D)}$ that is infinite\\\\\n$ \\textbf{(E)}$ greater than the semi-circumference but finite", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c4h255302p1394463", "category": "A"}
