{"answer": "A", "latex": "Two cyclists, $ k$ miles apart, and starting at the same time, would be together in $ r$ hours if they traveled in the same direction, but would pass each other in $ t$ hours if they traveled in opposite directions. The ratio of the speed of the faster cyclist to that of the slower is:\\\\\n\\\\\n$ \\textbf{(A)}\\ \\frac {r + t}{r - t} \\qquad\\textbf{(B)}\\ \\frac {r}{r - t} \\qquad\\textbf{(C)}\\ \\frac {r + t}{r} \\qquad\\textbf{(D)}\\ \\frac {r}{t} \\qquad\\textbf{(E)}\\ \\frac {r + k}{t - k}$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c4h255307p1394469", "category": "A"}
