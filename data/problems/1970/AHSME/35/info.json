{"answer": "D", "latex": "A retiring employee receives and annual pension proportional to the square root of the number of years of his service. Had he served $a$ years more, his pension would have been $p$ dollars greater, whereas, had he served $b$ years more $b\\neq a$, his pension would have been $q$ dollars greater than the original annual pension. Find his annual pension in terms of $a,b,p,$ and $q$.\\\\\n\\\\\n$\\textbf{(A) }\\dfrac{p^2-q^2}{2(a-b)}\\qquad\\textbf{(B) }\\dfrac{(p-q)^2}{2\\sqrt{ab}}\\qquad\\textbf{(C) }\\dfrac{ap^2-bq^2}{2(ap-bq)}\\qquad\\textbf{(D) }\\dfrac{aq^2-bp^2}{2(bp-aq)}\\qquad \\textbf{(E) }\\sqrt{(a-b)(p-q)}$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h585783p3464742", "category": "A"}
