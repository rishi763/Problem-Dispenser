{"answer": "E", "latex": "In a narrow alley of width $w$ a ladder of length $a$ is placed with its foot at point $P$ between the walls. Resting against one wall at $Q$, the distance $k$ above the ground makes a $45^\\circ$ angle with the ground. Resting against the other wall at $R$, a distance $h$ above the ground, the ladder makes a $75^\\circ$ angle with the ground. The width $w$ is equal to\\\\\n\\\\\n$\\textbf {(A) } a \\qquad \\textbf {(B) } RQ \\qquad \\textbf {(C) } k \\qquad \\textbf {(D) } \\frac{h+k}{2} \\qquad \\textbf {(E) } h$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c4h70691p412549", "category": "G"}
