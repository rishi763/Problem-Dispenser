{"answer": "D", "latex": "Alice, Bob, and Carol repeatedly take turns tossing a die. Alice begins; Bob always follows Alice; Carol always follows Bob; and Alice always follows Carol. Find the probability that Carol will be the first one to toss a six. (The probability of obtaining a six on any toss is $ \\frac{1}{6}$, independent of the outcome of any other toss.)\\\\\n\\\\\n$ \\textbf{(A)}\\ \\frac{1}{3}\\qquad \n\\textbf{(B)}\\ \\frac{2}{9}\\qquad \n\\textbf{(C)}\\ \\frac{5}{18}\\qquad \n\\textbf{(D)}\\ \\frac{25}{91}\\qquad \n\\textbf{(E)}\\ \\frac{36}{91}$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c4h252282p1380754", "category": ""}
