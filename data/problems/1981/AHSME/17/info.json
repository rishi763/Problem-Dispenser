{"answer": "B", "latex": "The function $f$ is not defined for $x=0$, but, for all non-zero real numbers $x$, $f(x)+2f\\left( \\frac1x \\right)=3x$. The equation $f(x)=f(-x)$ is satisfied by\\\\\n\\\\\n$\\text{(A)} ~\\text{exactly one real number}$\\\\\n$\\text{(B)}~\\text{exactly two real numbers}$\\\\\n$\\text{(C)} ~\\text{no real numbers}$\\\\\n$\\text{(D)} ~\\text{infinitely many, but not all, non-zero real numbers}$\\\\\n$\\text{(E)} ~\\text{all non-zero real numbers}$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c4h83226p477701", "category": ""}
