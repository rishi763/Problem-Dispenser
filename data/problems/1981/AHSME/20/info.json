{"answer": "B", "latex": "A ray of light originates from point $A$ and and travels in a plane, being reflected $n$ times between lines $AD$ and $CD$, before striking a point $B$  (which may be on $AD$ or $CD$) perpendicularly and retracing its path to $A$. (At each point of reflection the light makes two equal angles as indicated in the adjoining figure. The figure shows the light path for $n = 3.$) If $\\measuredangle CDA = 8^\\circ$, what is the largest value $n$ can have?\\\\\n\\\\\n$\\text{(A)} \\ 6 \\qquad \\text{(B)} \\ 10 \\qquad \\text{(C)} \\ 38 \\qquad \\text{(D)} \\ 98 \\qquad \\text{(E)} \\ \\text{There is no largest value.}$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h65221p386472", "category": ""}
