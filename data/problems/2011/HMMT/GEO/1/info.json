{"latex": "Let $ABC$ be a triangle such that $AB = 7$, and let the angle bisector of $\\angle BAC$ intersect line $BC$ at $D$. If there exist points $E$ and $F$ on sides $AC$ and $BC$, respectively, such that lines $AD$ and $EF$ are parallel and divide triangle $ABC$ into three parts of equal area, determine the number of possible integral values for $BC$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c129h520357p2930889", "category": ""}
