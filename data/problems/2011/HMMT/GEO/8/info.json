{"latex": "Collinear points $A$, $B$, and $C$ are given in the Cartesian plane such that $A= (a, 0)$ lies along the x-axis, $B$ lies along the line $y=x$, $C$ lies along the line $y=2x$, and $\\frac{AB}{BC}=2$. If $D= (a, a)$, and the circumcircle of triangle $ADC$ intersects the line $y=x$ again at $E$, and ray $AE$ intersects $y=2x$ at $F$, evaluate $\\frac{AE}{EF}$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c129h486942p2728479", "category": ""}
