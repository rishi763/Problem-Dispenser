{"answer": "C", "latex": "A bug travels in the coordinate plane, moving only along the lines that are parallel to the $x$-axis or $y$-axis. Let $A=(-3, 2)$ and $B=(3, -2)$. Consider all possible paths of the bug from $A$ to $B$ of length at most $20$. How many points with integer coordinates lie on at least one of these paths?\\\\\n\\\\\n$ \\textbf{(A)}\\ 161  \\qquad\n\\textbf{(B)}\\ 185  \\qquad\n\\textbf{(C)}\\  195 \\qquad\n\\textbf{(D)}\\  227 \\qquad\n\\textbf{(E)}\\ 255  $", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h393408p2186352", "category": ""}
