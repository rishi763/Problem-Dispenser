{"answer": "C", "latex": "Let $f(z)=\\frac{z+a}{z+b}$ and $g(z)=f(f(z))$, where $a$ and $b$ are complex numbers. Suppose that $|a|=1$ and $g(g(z))=z$ for all $z$ for which $g(g(z))$ is defined. What is the difference between the largest and smallest possible values of $|b|$?\\\\\n\\\\\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ 0 \\qquad\n\\textbf{(B)}\\ \\sqrt{2}-1 \\qquad\n\\textbf{(C)}\\ \\sqrt{3}-1  \\qquad\n\\textbf{(D)}\\ 1 \\qquad\n\\textbf{(E)}\\ 2$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h390787p2171376", "category": "A"}
