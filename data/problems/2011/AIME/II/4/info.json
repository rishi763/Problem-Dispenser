{"answer": "051", "latex": "In triangle $ABC$, $AB=\\frac{20}{11} AC$. The angle bisector of $\\angle A$ intersects $BC$ at point $D$, and point $M$ is the midpoint of $AD$. Let $P$ be the point of the intersection of $AC$ and $BM$. The ratio of $CP$ to $PA$ can be expressed in the form $\\dfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h399691p2224401", "category": "G"}
