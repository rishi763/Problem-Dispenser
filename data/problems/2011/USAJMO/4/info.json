{"latex": "A \\textit{word} is defined as any finite string of letters. A word is a \\textit{palindrome} if it reads the same backwards and forwards. Let a sequence of words $W_0, W_1, W_2,...$ be defined as follows: $W_0 = a, W_1 = b$, and for $n \\ge 2$, $W_n$ is the word formed by writing $W_{n-2}$ followed by $W_{n-1}$. Prove that for any $n \\ge 1$, the word formed by writing $W_1, W_2, W_3,..., W_n$ in succession is a palindrome.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h404353p2254808", "category": ""}
