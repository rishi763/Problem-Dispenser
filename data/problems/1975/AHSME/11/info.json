{"answer": "E", "latex": "Let $ P$ be an interior point of circle $ K$ other than the center of $ K$.  Form all chords of $ K$ which pass through $ P$, and determine their midpoints.  The locus of these midpoints is\\\\\n\\\\\n$ \\textbf{(A)}\\ \\text{a circle with one point deleted} \\qquad$\\\\\n$ \\textbf{(B)}\\ \\text{a circle if the distance from } P \\text{ to the center of } K \\text{ is less than}$\\\\\n$ \\text{one half the radius of } K \\text{; otherwise a circular arc of less than}$\\\\\n$ 360^{\\circ}\\qquad$\\\\\n$ \\textbf{(C)}\\ \\text{a semicircle with one point deleted} \\qquad$\\\\\n$ \\textbf{(D)}\\ \\text{a semicircle} \\qquad$\\\\\n$ \\textbf{(E)}\\ \\text{a circle}$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c4h336873p1802418", "category": ""}
