{"answer": "758", "latex": "A deck of forty cards consists of four 1's, four 2's,..., and four 10's.  A matching pair (two cards with the same number) is removed from the deck.  Given that these cards are not returned to the deck, let $m/n$ be the probability that two randomly selected cards also form a pair, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers.  Find $m+n.$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c4h64992p385886", "category": "C"}
