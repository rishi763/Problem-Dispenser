{"answer": "D", "latex": "Through a point on the hypotenuse of a right triangle, lines are drawn parallel to the legs of the triangle so that the trangle is divided into a square and two smaller right triangles. The area of one of the two small right triangles is $m$ times the area of the square. The ratio of the area of the other small right triangle to the area of the square is\\\\\n\\\\\n$\\text{(A)}\\ \\frac1{2m+1}\\qquad\\text{(B)}\\ m \\qquad\\text{(C)}\\ 1-m\\qquad\\text{(D)}\\ \\frac1{4m} \\qquad\\text{(E)}\\ \\frac1{8m^2}$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c4h76392p438918", "category": ""}
