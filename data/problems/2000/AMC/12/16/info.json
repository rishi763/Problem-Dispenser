{"answer": "D", "latex": "A checkerboard of $ 13$ rows and $ 17$ columns has a number written in each square, beginning in the upper left corner, so that the first row is numbered $ 1, 2, \\ldots , 17$, the second row $ 18, 19, \\ldots , 34$, and so on down the board. If the board is renumbered so that the left column, top to bottom, is $ 1, 2, \\ldots , 13$, the second column $ 14, 15, \\ldots , 26$ and so on across the board, some squares have the same numbers in both numbering systems. Find the sum of the numbers in these squares (under either system).\\\\\n\\\\\n$ \\textbf{(A)}\\ 222 \\qquad \\textbf{(B)}\\ 333 \\qquad \\textbf{(C)}\\ 444 \\qquad \\textbf{(D)}\\ 555 \\qquad \\textbf{(E)}\\ 666$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c4h195166p1072002", "category": "N"}
