{"answer": "D", "latex": "Through a point on the hypotenuse of a right triangle, lines are drawn parallel to the legs of the triangle so that the triangle is divided into a square and two smaller right triangles. The area of one of the two small right triangles is $ m$ times the area of the square. The ratio of the area of the other small right triangle to the area of the square is\\\\\n\\\\\n$ \\textbf{(A)}\\ \\frac {1}{2m + 1} \\qquad \\textbf{(B)}\\ m \\qquad \\textbf{(C)}\\ 1 - m \\qquad \\textbf{(D)}\\ \\frac {1}{4m} \\qquad \\textbf{(E)}\\ \\frac {1}{8m^2}$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c4h195313p1072774", "category": "G"}
