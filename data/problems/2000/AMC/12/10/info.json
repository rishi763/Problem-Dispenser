{"answer": "E", "latex": "The point $ P = (1,2,3)$ is reflected in the $ xy$-plane, then its image $ Q$ is rotated by $ 180^\\circ$ about the $ x$-axis to produce $ R$, and finally, $ R$ is translated by 5 units in the positive-$ y$ direction to produce $ S$. What are the coordinates of $ S$?\\\\\n\\\\\n$ \\textbf{(A)}\\  (1,7, - 3) \\qquad \\textbf{(B)}\\  ( - 1,7, - 3) \\qquad \\textbf{(C)}\\  ( - 1, - 2,8) \\qquad \\textbf{(D)}\\  ( - 1,3,3) \\qquad \\textbf{(E)}\\  (1,3,3)$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c4h61602p369789", "category": "G"}
