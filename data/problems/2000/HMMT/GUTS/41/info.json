{"latex": "A person observes a building of height $h$ at an angle of inclination $\\alpha$ from a point on the ground. After walking a distance $a$ towards it, the angle is now $2\\alpha$, and walking a further distance $b$ causes it to increase to $3\\alpha$. Find $h$ in terms of $a$ and $b$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c129h611417p3635173", "category": ""}
