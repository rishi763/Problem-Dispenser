{"answer": "B", "latex": "The amount $2.5$ is split into two nonnegative real numbers uniformly at random, for instance, into $2.143$ and $.357$, or into $\\sqrt{3}$ and $2.5-\\sqrt{3}.$ Then each number is rounded to its nearest integer, for instance, $2$ and $0$ in the first case above, $2$ and $1$ in the second. What is the probability that the two integers sum to $3$?\\\\\n\\\\\n$ \\textbf{(A)}\\ \\frac{1}{4} \\qquad\\textbf{(B)}\\ \\frac{2}{5} \\qquad\\textbf{(C)}\\ \\frac{1}{2} \\qquad\\textbf{(D)}\\ \\frac{3}{5} \\qquad\\textbf{(E)}\\ \\frac{3}{4} $", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h455394p2559377", "category": "A"}
