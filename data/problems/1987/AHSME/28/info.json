{"answer": "D", "latex": "Let $a, b, c, d$ be real numbers. Suppose that all the roots of $z^4+az^3+bz^2+cz+d=0$ are complex numbers lying on a circle in the complex plane centered at $0+0i$ and having radius $1$. The sum of the reciprocals of the roots is necessarily\\\\\n\\\\\n$ \\textbf{(A)}\\ a \\qquad\\textbf{(B)}\\ b \\qquad\\textbf{(C)}\\ c \\qquad\\textbf{(D)}\\ -a \\qquad\\textbf{(E)}\\ -b $", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h455396p2559385", "category": "A"}
