{"answer": "D", "latex": "A cryptographer devises the following method for encoding positive integers. First, the integer is expressed in base $5$. Second, a 1-to-1 correspondence is established between the digits that appear in the expressions in base $5$ and the elements of the set $\\{V, W, X, Y, Z\\}$. Using this correspondence, the cryptographer finds that three consecutive integers in increasing order are coded as $VYZ$, $VYX$, $VVW$, respectively. What is the base-10 expression for the integer coded as $XYZ$?\\\\\n\\\\\n$ \\textbf{(A)}\\ 48 \\qquad\\textbf{(B)}\\ 71 \\qquad\\textbf{(C)}\\ 82 \\qquad\\textbf{(D)}\\ 108 \\qquad\\textbf{(E)}\\ 113$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h455383p2559341", "category": "A"}
