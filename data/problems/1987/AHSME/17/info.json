{"answer": "E", "latex": "In a mathematics competition, the sum of the scores of Bill and Dick equalled the sum of the scores of Ann and Carol. If the scores of Bill and Carol had been interchanged, then the sum of the scores of Ann and Carol would have exceeded the sum of the scores of the other two. Also, Dick's score exceeded the sum of the scores of Bill and Carol. Determine the order in which the four contestants finished, from highest to lowest.
