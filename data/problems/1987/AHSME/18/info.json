{"answer": "D", "latex": "It takes $A$ algebra books (all the same thickness) and $H$ geometry books (all the same thickness, which is greater than that of an algebra book) to completely fill a certain shelf. Also, $S$ of the algebra books and $M$ of the geometry books would fill the same shelf. Finally, $E$ of the algebra books alone would fill this shelf. Given that $A, H, S, M, E$ are distinct positive integers, it follows that $E$ is\\\\\n\\\\\n$ \\textbf{(A)}\\ \\frac{AM+SH}{M+H} \\qquad\\textbf{(B)}\\ \\frac{AM^2+SH^2}{M^2+H^2} \\qquad\\textbf{(C)}\\ \\frac{AH-SM}{M-H} \\qquad\\textbf{(D)}\\ \\frac{AM-SH}{M-H} \\qquad\\textbf{(E)}\\ \\frac{AM^2-SH^2}{M^2-H^2} $", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h455385p2559349", "category": "A"}
