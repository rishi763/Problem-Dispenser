{"answer": "C", "latex": "A point $P$ lies in the same plane as a given square of side $1$.  Let the vertices of the square, taken counterclockwise, be $A$, $B$, $C$ and $D$.  Also, let the distances from $P$ to $A$, $B$ and $C$, respectively, be $u$, $v$ and $w$.  What is the greatest distance that $P$ can be from $D$ if $u^2 + v^2 = w^2$?\\\\\n\\\\\n$ \\textbf{(A)}\\ 1 + \\sqrt{2}\\qquad\\textbf{(B)}\\ 2\\sqrt{2}\\qquad\\textbf{(C)}\\ 2 + \\sqrt{2}\\qquad\\textbf{(D)}\\ 3\\sqrt{2}\\qquad\\textbf{(E)}\\ 3 + \\sqrt{2}$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h434121p2452025", "category": ""}
