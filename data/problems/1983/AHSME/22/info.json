{"answer": "B", "latex": "Consider the two functions \\[f(x) = x^2+2bx+1\\quad\\text{and}\\quad g(x) = 2a(x+b),\\]where the variable $x$ and the constants $a$ and $b$ are real numbers. Each such pair of the constants $a$ and $b$ may be considered as a point $(a,b)$ in an $ab-$plane. Let $S$ be the set of such points $(a,b)$ for which the graphs of $y = f(x)$ and $y = g(x)$ do NOT intersect (in the $xy-$ plane.). The area of $S$ is\\\\\n\\\\\n$\\textbf{(A)} \\ 1 \\qquad \\textbf{(B)} \\ \\pi \\qquad \\textbf{(C)} \\ 4 \\qquad \\textbf{(D)} \\ 4 \\pi \\qquad \\textbf{(E)} \\ \\text{infinite}$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c4h74532p429820", "category": ""}
