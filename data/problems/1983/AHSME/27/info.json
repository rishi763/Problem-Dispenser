{"answer": "E", "latex": "A large sphere is on a horizontal field on a sunny day.  At a certain time the shadow of the sphere reaches out a distance of $10$ m from the point where the sphere touches the ground.  At the same instant a meter stick (held vertically with one end on the ground) casts a shadow of length $2$ m.  What is the radius of the sphere in meters?  (Assume the sun's rays are parallel and the meter stick is a line segment.)\\\\\n\\\\\n$ \\textbf{(A)}\\ \\frac{5}{2}\\qquad\\textbf{(B)}\\ 9 - 4\\sqrt{5}\\qquad\\textbf{(C)}\\ 8\\sqrt{10} - 23\\qquad\\textbf{(D)}\\ 6 - \\sqrt{15}\\qquad\\textbf{(E)}\\ 10\\sqrt{5} - 20 $", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h434109p2451942", "category": ""}
