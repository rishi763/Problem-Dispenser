{"answer": "A", "latex": "A calculator has a key which replaces the displayed entry with its square, and another key which replaces the displayed entry with its reciprocal. Let $y$ be the final result if one starts with an entry $x \\neq 0$ and alternately squares and reciprocates $n$ times each. Assuming the calculator is completely accurate (e.g., no roundoff or overflow), then $y$ equals\\\\\n\\\\\nA. $x^{((-2)^n)}$\\\\\nB. $x^{2n}$\\\\\nC. $x^{-2n}$\\\\\nD. $x^{-(2^n)}$\\\\\nE. $x^{((-1)^n 2n)}$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c4h56521p349253", "category": ""}
