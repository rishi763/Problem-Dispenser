{"answer": "D", "latex": "Consider the graphs of (1): $ y=x^2-\\frac{1}{2}x+2$ and (2) $ y=x^2+\\frac{1}{2}x+2$ on the same set of axis.  These parabolas are exactly the same shape.  Then:\\\\\n\\\\\n$ \\textbf{(A)}\\ \\text{the graphs coincide.} \\\\\n\\textbf{(B)}\\ \\text{the graph of (1) is lower than the graph of (2).} \\\\\n\\textbf{(C)}\\ \\text{the graph of (1) is to the left of the graph of (2).} \\\\\n\\textbf{(D)}\\ \\text{the graph of (1) is to the right of the graph of (2).} \\\\\n\\textbf{(E)}\\ \\text{the graph of (1) is higher than the graph of (2).}$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c4h256279p1398596", "category": ""}
