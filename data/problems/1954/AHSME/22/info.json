{"answer": "B", "latex": "The expression $ \\frac{2x^2-x}{(x+1)(x-2)}-\\frac{4+x}{(x+1)(x-2)}$ cannot be evaluated for $ x=-1$ or $ x=2$, since division by zero is not allowed.  For other values of $ x$:\\\\\n\\\\\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ \\text{The expression takes on many different values.} \\\\\n\\textbf{(B)}\\ \\text{The expression has only the value 2.} \\\\\n\\textbf{(C)}\\ \\text{The expression has only the value 1.} \\\\\n\\textbf{(D)}\\ \\text{The expression always has a value between } -1 \\text{ and } +2. \\\\\n\\textbf{(E)}\\ \\text{The expression has a value greater than 2 or less than } -1.$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c4h256245p1398466", "category": ""}
