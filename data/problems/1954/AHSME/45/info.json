{"answer": "D", "latex": "In a rhombus, $ ABCD$, line segments are drawn within the rhombus, parallel to diagonal $ BD$, and terminated in the sides of the rhombus.  A graph is drawn showing the length of a segment as a function of its distance from vertex $ A$.  The graph is:\\\\\n\\\\\n$ \\textbf{(A)}\\ \\text{A straight line passing through the origin.} \\\\\n\\textbf{(B)}\\ \\text{A straight line cutting across the upper right quadrant.} \\\\\n\\textbf{(C)}\\ \\text{Two line segments forming an upright V.} \\\\\n\\textbf{(D)}\\ \\text{Two line segments forming an inverted V.} \\\\\n\\textbf{(E)}\\ \\text{None of these.}$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c4h256422p1399269", "category": ""}
