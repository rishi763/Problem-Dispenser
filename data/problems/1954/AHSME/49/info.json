{"answer": "C", "latex": "The difference of the squares of two odd numbers is always divisible by $ 8$.  If $ a>b$, and $ 2a+1$ and $ 2b+1$ are the odd numbers, to prove the given statement we put the difference of the squares in the form:\\\\\n\\\\\n$ \\textbf{(A)}\\ (2a+1)^2-(2b+1)^2 \\\\\n\\textbf{(B)}\\ 4a^2-4b^2+4a-4b \\\\\n\\textbf{(C)}\\ 4[a(a+1)-b(b+1)] \\\\\n\\textbf{(D)}\\ 4(a-b)(a+b+1) \\\\\n\\textbf{(E)}\\ 4(a^2+a-b^2-b)$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c4h256427p1399287", "category": ""}
