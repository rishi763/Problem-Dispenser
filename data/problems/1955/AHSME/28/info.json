{"answer": "E", "latex": "On the same set of axes are drawn the graph of $ y=ax^2+bx+c$ and the graph of the equation obtained by replacing $ x$ by $ -x$ in the given equation.  If $ b \\neq 0$ and $ c \\neq 0$ these two graphs intersect:\\\\\n\\\\\n$ \\textbf{(A)}\\ \\text{in two points, one on the x-axis and one on the y-axis}\\\\\n\\textbf{(B)}\\ \\text{in one point located on neither axis} \\\\\n\\textbf{(C)}\\ \\text{only at the origin} \\\\\n\\textbf{(D)}\\ \\text{in one point on the x-axis} \\\\\n\\textbf{(E)}\\ \\text{in one point on the y-axis}$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c4h257176p1402618", "category": ""}
