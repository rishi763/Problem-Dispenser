{"latex": "The \\textit{rank} of a rational number $q$ is the unique $k$ for which $q=\\frac{1}{a_1}+\\cdots+\\frac{1}{a_k}$, where each $a_i$ is the smallest positive integer $q$ such that $q\\geq \\frac{1}{a_1}+\\cdots+\\frac{1}{a_i}$.  Let $q$ be the largest rational number less than $\\frac{1}{4}$ with rank $3$, and suppose the expression for $q$ is $\\frac{1}{a_1}+\\frac{1}{a_2}+\\frac{1}{a_3}$.
