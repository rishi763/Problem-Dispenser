{"latex": "Let $f(x)=cx(x-1)$, where $c$ is a positive real number.  We use $f^n(x)$ to denote the polynomial obtained by composing $f$ with itself $n$ times.  For every positive integer $n$, all the roots of $f^n(x)$ are real.  What is the smallest possible value of $c$?", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c129h489046p2741054", "category": ""}
