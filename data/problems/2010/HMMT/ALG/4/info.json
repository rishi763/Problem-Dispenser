{"latex": "Suppose that there exist nonzero complex numbers $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ such that $k$ is a root of both the equations $ax^3+bx^2+cx+d=0$ and $bx^3+cx^2+dx+a=0$.  Find all possible values of $k$ (including complex values).", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c129h489040p2741042", "category": ""}
