{"latex": "Let $f(x)=x^3-x^2$.  For a given value of $x$, the graph of $f(x)$, together with the graph of the line $c+x$, split the plane up into regions.  Suppose that $c$ is such that exactly two of these regions have finite area.  Find the value of $c$ that minimizes the sum of the areas of these two regions.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c129h489055p2741081", "category": ""}
