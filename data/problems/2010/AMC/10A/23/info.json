{"answer": "A", "latex": "Each of 2010 boxes in a line contains a single red marble, and for $ 1 \\le k \\le 2010$, the box in the $ kth$ position also contains $ k$ white marbles. Isabella begins at the first box and successively draws a single marble at random from each box, in order. She stops when she first draws a red marble. Let $ P(n)$ be the probability that Isabella stops after drawing exactly $ n$ marbles. What is the smallest value of $ n$ for which $ P(n) < \\frac {1}{2010}$?\\\\\n\\\\\n$ \\textbf{(A)}\\ 45  \\qquad\n\\textbf{(B)}\\ 63  \\qquad\n\\textbf{(C)}\\ 64  \\qquad\n\\textbf{(D)}\\ 201 \\qquad\n\\textbf{(E)}\\ 1005$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h330812p1770147", "category": ""}
