{"answer": "A", "latex": "Angelina drove at an average rate of $ 80$ kph and then stopped $ 20$ minutes for gas. After the stop, she drove at an average rate of $ 100$ kph. Altogether she drove $ 250$ km in a total trip time of $ 3$ hours including the stop. Which equation could be used to solve for the time $ t$ in hours that she drove before her stop?\\\\\n\\\\\n$ \\textbf{(A)}\\ 80t+100(8/3-t)=250 \\qquad\n\\textbf{(B)}\\ 80t=250 \\qquad\n\\textbf{(C)}\\ 100t=250 \\\\\n\\textbf{(D)}\\ 90t=250 \\qquad\n\\textbf{(E)}\\ 80(8/3-t)+100t=250$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h330937p1770827", "category": ""}
