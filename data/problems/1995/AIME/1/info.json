{"answer": "255", "latex": "Square $S_{1}$ is $1\\times 1.$  For $i\\ge 1,$ the lengths of the sides of square $S_{i+1}$ are half the lengths of the sides of square $S_{i},$ two adjacent sides of square $S_{i}$ are perpendicular bisectors of two adjacent sides of square $S_{i+1},$ and the other two sides of square $S_{i+1},$ are the perpendicular bisectors of two adjacent sides of square $S_{i+2}.$  The total area enclosed by at least one of $S_{1}, S_{2}, S_{3}, S_{4}, S_{5}$ can be written in the form $m/n,$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers.  Find $m-n.$\\\\\n\\\\\n\n\\begin{asy}\nimport olympiad;\nimport cse5;\ndefaultpen(white);\nsize(100);\n\nsize(250);\npath p=rotate(45)*polygon(4);\nint i;\nfor(i=0; i<5; i=i+1) {\ndraw(shift(2-(1/2)^(i-1),0)*scale((1/2)^i)*p);\n}\nlabel(\"$S_1$\", (0,-0.75));\nlabel(\"$S_2$\", (1,-0.75));\nlabel(\"$S_3$\", (3/2,-0.75));\nlabel(\"$\\cdots$\", (7/4, -3/4));\nlabel(\"$\\cdots$\", (2.25, 0));\n\\end{asy}\n\\\\\n", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c4h127125p721577", "category": "G"}
