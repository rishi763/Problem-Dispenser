{"latex": "Circle $\\omega$ has radius $5$ and is centered at $O$.  Point $A$ lies outside $\\omega$ such that $OA=13$.  The two tangents to $\\omega$ passing through $A$ are drawn, and points $B$ and $C$ are chosen on them (one on each tangent), such that line $BC$ is tangent to $\\omega$ and $\\omega$ lies outside triangle $ABC$.  Compute $AB+AC$ given that $BC=7$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c129h485250p2718678", "category": ""}
