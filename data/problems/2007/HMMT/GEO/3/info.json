{"latex": "Circles $\\omega_1$, $\\omega_2$, and $\\omega_3$ are centered at $M$, $N$, and $O$, respectively.  The points of tangency between $\\omega_2$ and $\\omega_3$, $\\omega_3$ and $\\omega_1$, and $\\omega_1$ and $\\omega_2$ are tangent at $A$, $B$, and $C$, respectively.  Line $MO$ intersects $\\omega_3$ and $\\omega_1$ again at $P$ and $Q$ respectively, and line $AP$ intersects $\\omega_2$ again at $R$.  Given that $ABC$ is an equilateral triangle of side length $1$, compute the area of $PQR$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c129h485249p2718676", "category": ""}
