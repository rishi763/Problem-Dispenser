{"latex": "\\textit{The Marathon.}  Let $\\omega$ denote the incircle of triangle $ABC$.  The segments $BC$, $CA$, and $AB$ are tangent to $\\omega$ at $D$, $E$ and $F$, respectively.  Point $P$ lies on $EF$ such that segment $PD$ is perpendicular to $BC$.  The line $AP$ intersects $BC$ at $Q$.  The circles $\\omega_1$ and $\\omega_2$ pass through $B$ and $C$, respectively, and are tangent to $AQ$ at $Q$; the former meets $AB$ again at $X$, and the latter meets $AC$ again at $Y$.  The line $XY$ intersects $BC$ at $Z$.  Given that $AB=15$, $BC=14$, and $CA=13$, find $\\lfloor XZ\\cdot YZ\\rfloor$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c129h485300p2718809", "category": ""}
