{"latex": "Convex quadrilateral $ABCD$ has right angles $\\angle A$ and $\\angle C$ and is such that $AB=BC$ and $AD=CD$.  The diagonals $AC$ and $BD$ intersect at point $M$.  Points $P$ and $Q$ lie on the circumcircle of triangle $AMB$ and segment $CD$, respectively, such that points $P$, $M$, and $Q$ are collinear.  Suppose that $m\\angle ABC=160^\\circ$ and $m\\angle QMC=40^\\circ$.  Find $MP\\cdot MQ$, given that $MC=6$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c129h485280p2718764", "category": ""}
