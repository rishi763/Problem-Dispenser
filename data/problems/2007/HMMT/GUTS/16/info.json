{"latex": "Let $ABC$ be a triangle with $AB=7$, $BC=9$, and $CA=4$.  Let $D$ be the point such that $AB\\parallel CD$ amd $CA\\parallel BD$.  Let $R$ be a point within triangle $BCD$.  Lines $\\ell$ and $m$ going through $R$ are parallel to $CA$ and $AB$ respectively.  Line $\\ell$ meets $AB$ and $BC$ at $P$ and $P^\\prime$ respectively, and $m$ meets $CA$ and $BC$ at $Q$ and $Q^\\prime$ respectively.  If $S$ denotes the largest possible sum of the areas of triangle $BPP^\\prime$, $RP^\\prime Q^\\prime$, and $CQQ^\\prime$, determine the value of $S^2$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c129h485278p2718757", "category": ""}
