{"latex": "\\textit{The Game.} Eric and Greg are watching their new favorite TV show, \\textit{The Price is Right}. Bob Barker recently raised the intellectual level of his program, and he begins the latest installment with bidding on following question: How many Carmichael numbers are there less than $100,000$?\\\\\n\\\\\nEach team is to list one nonnegative integer not greater than $100,000$. Let $X$ denote the answer to Bob's question. The teams listing $N$, a maximal bid (of those submitted) not greater than $X$, will receive $N$ points, and all other teams will neither receive nor lose points. (A Carmichael number is an odd composite integer $n$ such that $n$ divides $a^{n-1}-1$ for all integers $a$ relatively prime to $n$ with $1<a<n$.)", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c129h485297p2718802", "category": ""}
