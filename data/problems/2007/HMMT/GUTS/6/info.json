{"latex": "There are three video game systems: the Paystation, the WHAT, and the ZBoz2$\\pi$, and none of these systems will play games for the other systems. Uncle Riemann has three nephews: Bernoulli, Galois, and Dirac. Bernoulli owns a Paystation and a WHAT, Galois owns a WHAT and a ZBoz2$\\pi$, and Dirac owns a ZBoz2$\\pi$ and a Paystation. A store sells $4$ different games for the Paystation, $6$ different games for the WHAT, and $10$ different games for the ZBoz2$\\pi$. Uncle Riemann does not understand the difference between the systems, so he walks into the store and buys $3$ random games (not necessarily distinct) and randomly hands them to his nephews. What is the probability that each nephew receives a game he can play?", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c129h485262p2718709", "category": ""}
