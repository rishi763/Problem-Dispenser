It is said to be \\textit{primitive} it its cells cannot be partitioned into two or more dinosaurs. Find with proof the maximum number of cells in a primitive dinosaur.\\\\\n\\\\\n(1) Animals are also called \\textit{polyominoes}. They can be defined inductively. Two cells are \\textit{adjacent} if they share a complete edge. A single cell is an animal, and given an animal with $n$ cells, one with $n+1$ cells is obtained by adjoining a new cell by making it adjacent to one or more existing cells.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c6h145848p825505", "category": "C"}
