{"answer": "B", "latex": "A player chooses one of the numbers $ 1$ through $ 4$. After the choice has been made, two regular four-sided (tetrahedral) dice are rolled, with the sides of the dice numbered $ 1$ through $ 4$. If the number chosen appears on the bottom of exactly one die after it is rolled, then the player wins $ \\$1$. If the number chosen appears on the bottom of both of the dice, then the player wins $ \\$2$. If the number chosen does not appear on the bottom of either of the dice, the player loses $ \\$1$. What is the expected return to the player, in dollars, for one roll of the dice?\\\\\n\\\\\n$ \\textbf{(A)}\\ -\\frac{1}{8}\\qquad \n\\textbf{(B)}\\ -\\frac{1}{16}\\qquad \n\\textbf{(C)}\\ 0\\qquad \n\\textbf{(D)}\\ \\frac{1}{16}\\qquad \n\\textbf{(E)}\\ \\frac{1}{8}$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c4h251587p1377110", "category": "C"}
