{"answer": "D", "latex": "A cryptographic code is designed as follows. The first time a letter appears in a given message it is replaced by the letter that is $ 1$ place to its right in the alphabet (assuming that the letter $ A$ is one place to the right of the letter $ Z$). The second time this same letter appears in the given message, it is replaced by the letter that is $ 1+2$ places to the right, the third time it is replaced by the letter that is $ 1 + 2 + 3$ places to the right, and so on. For example, with this code the word \"banana\" becomes \"cbodqg\". What letter will replace the last letter $ \\text{s}$ in the message \"Lee's sis is a Mississippi miss, Chriss!\"?\\\\\n\\\\\n$ \\textbf{(A)}\\ \\text{g}\\qquad \n\\textbf{(B)}\\ \\text{h}\\qquad \n\\textbf{(C)}\\ \\text{o}\\qquad \n\\textbf{(D)}\\ \\text{s}\\qquad \n\\textbf{(E)}\\ \\text{t}$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c4h251559p1376999", "category": ""}
