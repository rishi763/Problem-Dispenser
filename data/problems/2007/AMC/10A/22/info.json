{"answer": "D", "latex": "A finite sequence of three-digit integers has the property that the tens and units digits of each terms are, respectively, the hundreds and tens digits of the next term, and the tens and units digits of the last term are, respectively, the hundreds and tens digits of the first term. For example, such a sequence might begin with terms $ 247$, $ 475$, and $ 756$ and end with the term $ 824$. Let $ S$ be the sum of all the terms in the sequence. What is the largest prime number that always divides $ S$?\\\\\n\\\\\n$ \\textbf{(A)}\\ 3 \\qquad \\textbf{(B)}\\ 7 \\qquad \\textbf{(C)}\\ 13 \\qquad \\textbf{(D)}\\ 37 \\qquad \\textbf{(E)}\\ 43$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h132737p751380", "category": ""}
