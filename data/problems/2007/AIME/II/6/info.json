{"answer": "640", "latex": "An integer is called \\textit{parity-monotonic} if its decimal representation $a_{1}a_{2}a_{3}\\cdots a_{k}$ satisfies $a_{i}<a_{i+1}$ if $a_{i}$ is odd, and $a_{i}>a_{i+1}$ is $a_{i}$ is even. How many four-digit parity-monotonic integers are there?", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h141151p798263", "category": "N"}
