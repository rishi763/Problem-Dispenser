{"latex": "In a mathematical competition some competitors are friends. Friendship is always mutual. Call a group of competitors a \\textit{clique} if each two of them are friends. (In particular, any group of fewer than two competitiors is a clique.) The number of members of a clique is called its \\textit{size}.\\\\\n\\\\\nGiven that, in this competition, the largest size of a clique is even, prove that the competitors can be arranged into two rooms such that the largest size of a clique contained in one room is the same as the largest size of a clique contained in the other room.\\\\\n\\\\\n\\textit{Author: Vasily Astakhov, Russia}", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c6h159838p893746", "category": "C"}
