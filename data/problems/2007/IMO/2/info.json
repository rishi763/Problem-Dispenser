{"latex": "Consider five points $ A$, $ B$, $ C$, $ D$ and $ E$ such that $ ABCD$ is a parallelogram and $ BCED$ is a cyclic quadrilateral. Let $ \\ell$ be a line passing through $ A$. Suppose that $ \\ell$ intersects the interior of the segment $ DC$ at $ F$ and intersects line $ BC$ at $ G$. Suppose also that $ EF = EG = EC$. Prove that $ \\ell$ is the bisector of angle $ DAB$.\\\\\n\\\\\n\\textit{Author: Charles Leytem, Luxembourg}", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c6h159837p893744", "category": "G"}
