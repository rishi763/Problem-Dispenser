{"latex": "Consider a $2 \\times n$ grid of points and a path consisting of $2n-1$ straight line segments connecting all these $2n$ points, starting from the bottom left corner and ending at the upper right corner. Such a path is called $\\textit{efficient}$ if each point is only passed through once and no two line segments intersect. How many efficient paths are there when $n = 2016$?", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c129h1359327p7444592", "category": ""}
