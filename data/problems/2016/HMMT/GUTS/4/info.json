{"latex": "Consider a three-person game involving the following three types of fair six-sided dice.\\\\\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Dice of type $A$ have faces labelled $2$, $2$, $4$, $4$, $9$, $9$.\\\\\n\\item Dice of type $B$ have faces labelled $1$, $1$, $6$, $6$, $8$, $8$.\\\\\n\\item Dice of type $C$ have faces labelled $3$, $3$, $5$, $5$, $7$, $7$.\\\\\n\\end{itemize}\nAll three players simultaneously choose a die (more than one person can choose the same type of die, and the players don't know one another's choices) and roll it.  Then the score of a player $P$ is the number of players whose roll is less than $P$'s roll (and hence is either $0$, $1$, or $2$).\\\\\nAssuming all three players play optimally, what is the expected score of a particular player?", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c129h1359325p7444588", "category": ""}
