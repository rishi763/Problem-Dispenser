{"latex": "$\\textbf{(Self-Isogonal Cubics)}$ Let $ABC$ be a triangle with $AB = 2$, $AC = 3$, $BC = 4$. The $\\emph{isogonal conjugate}$ of a point $P$, denoted $P^\\ast$, is the point obtained by intersecting the reflection of lines $PA$, $PB$, $PC$ across the angle bisectors of $\\angle A$, $\\angle B$, and $\\angle C$, respectively.\\\\\n\\\\\nGiven a point $Q$, let $\\mathfrak K(Q)$ denote the unique cubic plane curve which passes through all points $P$ such that line $PP^\\ast$ contains $Q$.  Consider:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item the M'Cay cubic $\\mathfrak K(O)$,\\\\\nwhere $O$ is the circumcenter of $\\triangle ABC$,\n\\item the Thomson cubic $\\mathfrak K(G)$,\\\\\nwhere $G$ is the centroid of $\\triangle ABC$,\n\\item the Napoleon-Feurerbach cubic $\\mathfrak K(N)$,\\\\\nwhere $N$ is the nine-point center of $\\triangle ABC$,\n\\item the Darboux cubic $\\mathfrak K(L)$,\\\\\nwhere $L$ is the de Longchamps point\\\\\n(the reflection of the orthocenter across point $O$),\n\\item the Neuberg cubic $\\mathfrak K(X_{30})$,\\\\\nwhere $X_{30}$ is the point at infinity along line $OG$,\n\\item the nine-point circle of $\\triangle ABC$,\n\\item the incircle of $\\triangle ABC$, and\n\\item the circumcircle of $\\triangle ABC$.\n\\end{itemize}\nEstimate $N$, the number of points lying on at least two of these eight curves. An estimate of $E$ earns $\\left\\lfloor 20 \\cdot 2^{-|N-E|/6} \\right\\rfloor$ points.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c129h1359361p7444665", "category": ""}
