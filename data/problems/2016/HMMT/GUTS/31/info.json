{"latex": "For a positive integer $n$, denote by $\\tau(n)$ the number of positive integer divisors of $n$, and denote by $\\phi(n)$ the number of positive integers that are less than or equal to $n$ and relatively prime to $n$. Call a positive integer $n$ $\\emph{good}$ if $\\varphi (n) + 4\\tau (n) = n$. For example, the number $44$ is good because $\\varphi (44) + 4\\tau (44)= 44$.\\\\\n\\\\\nFind the sum of all good positive integers $n$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c129h1359355p7444646", "category": ""}
