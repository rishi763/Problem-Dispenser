{"latex": "A rectangular pool table has vertices at $(0, 0) (12, 0) (0, 10),$ and $(12, 10)$. There are pockets only in the four corners. A ball is hit from $(0, 0)$ along the line $y = x$ and bounces off several walls before eventually entering a pocket. Find the number of walls that the ball bounces off of before entering a pocket.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c129h1339266p7263840", "category": ""}
