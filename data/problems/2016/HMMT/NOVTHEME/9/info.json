{"latex": "The vertices of a regular nonagon are colored such that $1)$ adjacent vertices are different colors and $2)$ if $3$ vertices form an equilateral triangle, they are all different colors. Let $m$ be the minimum number of colors needed for a valid coloring, and n be the total number of colorings using $m$ colors. Determine $mn$. (Assume each vertex is distinguishable.)", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c129h1342708p7298001", "category": ""}
