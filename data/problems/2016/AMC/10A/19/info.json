{"answer": "E", "latex": "In rectangle $ABCD$, $AB=6$ and $BC=3$. Point $E$ between $B$ and $C$, and point $F$ between $E$ and $C$ are such that $BE=EF=FC$. Segments $\\overline{AE}$ and $\\overline{AF}$ intersect $\\overline{BD}$ at $P$ and $Q$, respectively. The ratio $BP:PQ:QD$ can be written as $r:s:t$, where the greatest common factor of $r,s$ and $t$ is $1$. What is $r+s+t$?\\\\\n\\\\\n$\\textbf{(A) } 7\n\\qquad \\textbf{(B) } 9\n\\qquad \\textbf{(C) } 12\n\\qquad \\textbf{(D) } 15\n\\qquad \\textbf{(E) } 20$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h1193606p5833477", "category": ""}
