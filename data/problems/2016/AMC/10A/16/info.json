{"answer": "D", "latex": "A triangle with vertices $A(0, 2)$, $B(-3, 2)$, and $C(-3, 0)$ is reflected about the $x$-axis, then the image $\\triangle A'B'C'$ is rotated counterclockwise about the origin by $90^{\\circ}$ to produce $\\triangle A''B''C''$. Which of the following transformations will return $\\triangle A''B''C''$ to $\\triangle ABC$?\\\\\n\\\\\n$\\textbf{(A)}$ counterclockwise rotation about the origin by $90^{\\circ}$.\\\\\n$\\textbf{(B)}$ clockwise rotation about the origin by $90^{\\circ}$.\\\\\n$\\textbf{(C)}$ reflection about the $x$-axis\\\\\n$\\textbf{(D)}$ reflection about the line $y = x$\\\\\n$\\textbf{(E)}$ reflection about the $y$-axis.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h1193594p5833381", "category": ""}
