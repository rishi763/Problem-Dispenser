{"answer": "B", "latex": "Jerry starts at 0 on the real number line. He tosses a fair coin 8 times. When he gets heads, he moves 1 unit in the positive direction; when he gets tails, he moves 1 unit in the negative direction. The probability that he reaches 4 at some time during this process is $a/b$, where $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $a+b$? (For example, he succeeds if his sequence of tosses is $HTHHHHHH$.)\\\\\n\\\\\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ 69\\qquad\\textbf{(B)}\\ 151\\qquad\\textbf{(C)}\\ 257\\qquad\\textbf{(D)}\\ 293\\qquad\\textbf{(E)}\\ 313$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h1193633p5833826", "category": ""}
