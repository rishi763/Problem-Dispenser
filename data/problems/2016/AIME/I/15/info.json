{"answer": "270", "latex": "Circles $\\omega_1$ and $\\omega_2$ intersect at points $X$ and $Y$. Line $\\ell$ is tangent to $\\omega_1$ and $\\omega_2$ at $A$ and $B$, respectively, with line $AB$ closer to point $X$ than to $Y$. Circle $\\omega$ passes through $A$ and $B$ intersecting $\\omega_1$ again at $D \\neq A$ and intersecting $\\omega_2$ again at $C \\neq B$. The three points $C$, $Y$, $D$ are collinear, $XC = 67$, $XY = 47$, and $XD = 37$. Find $AB^2$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h1207210p5966212", "category": ""}
