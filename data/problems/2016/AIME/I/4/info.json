{"answer": "108", "latex": "A right prism with height $h$ has bases that are regular hexagons with sides of length $12$. A vertex $A$ of the prism and its three adjacent vertices are the vertices of a triangular pyramid. The dihedral angle (the angle between the two planes) formed by the face of the pyramid that lies in a base of the prism and the face of the pyramid that does not contain $A$ measures $60^\\circ$. Find $h^2$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h1207192p5966138", "category": "G"}
