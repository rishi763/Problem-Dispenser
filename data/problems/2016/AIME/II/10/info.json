{"answer": "043", "latex": "Triangle $ABC$ is inscribed in circle $\\omega$. Points $P$ and $Q$ are on side $\\overline{AB}$ with $AP<AQ$. Rays $CP$ and $CQ$ meet $\\omega$ again at $S$ and $T$ (other than $C$), respectively. If $AP=4,PQ=3,QB=6,BT=5,$ and $AS=7$, then $ST=\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h1213133p6023615", "category": ""}
