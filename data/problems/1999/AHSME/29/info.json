{"answer": "C", "latex": "A tetrahedron with four equilateral triangular faces has a sphere inscribed within it and a sphere circumscribed about it. For each of the four faces, there is a sphere tangent externally to the face at its center and to the circumscribed sphere. A point $ P$ is selected at random inside the circumscribed sphere. The probability that $ P$ lies inside one of the five small spheres is closest to\\\\\n\\\\\n$ \\textbf{(A)}\\ 0\\qquad \n\\textbf{(B)}\\ 0.1\\qquad \n\\textbf{(C)}\\ 0.2\\qquad \n\\textbf{(D)}\\ 0.3\\qquad \n\\textbf{(E)}\\ 0.4$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c4h250635p1373045", "category": "G"}
