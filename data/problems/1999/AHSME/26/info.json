{"answer": "D", "latex": "Three non-overlapping regular plane polygons, at least two of which are congruent, all have sides of length $ 1$. The polygons meet at a point $ A$ in such a way that the sum of the three interior angles at $ A$ is $ 360^\\circ$. Thus the three polygons form a new polygon with $ A$ as an interior point. What is the largest possible perimeter that this polygon can have?\\\\\n\\\\\n$ \\textbf{(A)}\\ 12\\qquad \\textbf{(B)}\\ 14\\qquad \\textbf{(C)}\\ 18\\qquad \\textbf{(D)}\\ 21\\qquad \\textbf{(E)}\\ 24$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c4h250625p1373010", "category": ""}
