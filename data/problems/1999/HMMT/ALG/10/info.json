{"latex": "Pyramid $EARLY$ is placed in $(x,y,z)$ coordinates so that $E=(10,10,0),A=(10,-10,0)$, $R=(-10,-10,0)$, $L=(-10,10,0)$, and $Y=(0,0,10)$.  Tunnels are drilled through the pyramid in such a way that one can move from $(x,y,z)$ to any of the $9$ points $(x,y,z-1)$, $(x\\pm 1,y,z-1)$, $(x,y\\pm 1, z-1)$, $(x\\pm 1, y\\pm 1, z-1)$.  Sean starts at $Y$ and moves randomly down to the base of the pyramid, choosing each of the possible paths with probability $\\dfrac{1}{9}$.  What is the probability that he ends up at the point $(8,9,0)$?", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c129h485133p2718218", "category": ""}
