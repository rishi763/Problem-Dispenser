{"answer": "E", "latex": "When the natural numbers $P$ and $P'$, with $P>P'$, are divided by the natural number $D$, the remainders are $R$ and $R'$, respectively.  When $PP'$ and $RR'$ are divided by $D$, the remainders are $r$ and $r'$, respectively.  Then:\\\\\n\\\\\n$\\textbf{(A) }r>r'\\text{ always}\\qquad\n\\textbf{(B) }r<r'\\text{ always}\\qquad$\\\\\n$\\textbf{(C) }r>r'\\text{ sometimes, and }r<r'\\text{ sometimes}$\\\\\n$\\textbf{(D) }r>r'\\text{ sometimes, and }r=r'\\text{ sometimes}$\\\\\n$\\textbf{(E) }r=r'\\text{ always}$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h549873p3190588", "category": "N"}
