{"answer": "A", "latex": "Consider $A=\\{p,2p,\\dots,(q-1)p\\}$ and $B=\\{q,2q,\\dots,(p-1)q\\}$. It's easy to see that $A\\cap B=\\emptyset$, because assuming for some $0<i<q$, $0<j<p$ we have $ip=jq$, this implies that $q|i$ and $p|j$, impossible. Also, since all their elements are less than $pq$, we have $(A\\cup B)\\in \\{1,2,\\dots,pq-1\\}$. Hence we get $\\prod_{k\\in A\\cup B}k|(pq-1)!$.\\\\\nBut since $A\\cap B=\\emptyset$, here $\\prod_{k\\in A\\cup B}k=\\prod_{k\\in A}k\\cdot \\prod_{k\\in B}k=p^{q-1}(q-1)!\\cdot q^{p-1}(p-1)!$.
