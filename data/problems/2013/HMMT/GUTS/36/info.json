{"latex": "(Mathematicians A to Z) Below are the names of 26 mathematicians, one for each letter of the alphabet.  Your answer to this question should be a subset of $\\{A,B,\\cdots,Z\\}$, where each letter represents the corresponding mathematician.  If two mathematicians in your subset have birthdates that are within $20$ years of each other, then your score is $0$. Otherwise, your score is $\\max(3(k-3),0)$ where $k$ is the number of elements in your set.\\\\\n\\\\\n\\[\\begin{tabular}{cc}Niels Abel & Isaac Newton\\\\Etienne Bezout & Nicole Oresme \\\\ Augustin-Louis Cauchy & Blaise Pascal \\\\ Rene Descartes & Daniel Quillen \\\\ Leonhard Euler & Bernhard Riemann\\\\ Pierre Fatou & Jean-Pierre Serre \\\\ Alexander Grothendieck & Alan Turing \\\\ David Hilbert & Stanislaw Ulam \\\\ Kenkichi Iwasawa & John Venn \\\\ Carl Jacobi & Andrew Wiles \\\\ Andrey Kolmogorov & Leonardo Ximenes \\\\ Joseph-Louis Lagrange & Shing-Tung Yau \\\\ John Milnor & Ernst Zermelo\\end{tabular}\\]", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c129h526576p2986258", "category": ""}
