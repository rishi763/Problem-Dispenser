{"latex": "There are are $n$ children and $n$ toys such that each child has a strict preference ordering on the toys. We want to distribute the toys: say a distribution $A$ dominates a distribution $ B \\ne A $ if in $A$, each child receives at least as preferable of a toy as in $B$. Prove that if some distribution is not dominated by any other, then at least one child gets his/her favorite toy in that distribution.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c129h521840p2940711", "category": ""}
