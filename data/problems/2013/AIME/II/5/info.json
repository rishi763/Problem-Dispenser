Then $\\sin \\left( \\angle DAE \\right)$ can be expressed in the form $\\tfrac{a\\sqrt{b}}{c}$, where $a$ and $c$ are relatively prime positive integers, and $b$ is an integer that is not divisible by the square of any prime.  Find $a+b+c$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h528156p3003340", "category": ""}
