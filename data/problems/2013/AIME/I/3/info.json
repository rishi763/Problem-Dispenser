{"answer": "018", "latex": "Let $ABCD$ be a square, and let $E$ and $F$ be points on $\\overline{AB}$ and $\\overline{BC}$, respectively. The line through $E$ parallel to $\\overline{BC}$ and the line through $F$ parallel to $\\overline{AB}$ divide $ABCD$ into two squares and two non square rectangles. The sum of the areas of the two squares is $\\frac{9}{10}$ of the area of square $ABCD$. Find $\\frac{AE}{EB} + \\frac{EB}{AE}$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h525058p2969807", "category": ""}
