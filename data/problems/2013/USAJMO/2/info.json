{"latex": "Each cell of an $m\\times n$ board is filled with some nonnegative integer.  Two numbers in the filling are said to be \\textit{adjacent} if their cells share a common side.  (Note that two numbers in cells that share only a corner are not adjacent).  The filling is called a \\textit{garden} if it satisfies the following two conditions:\\\\\n\\\\\n(i) The difference between any two adjacent numbers is either $0$ or $1$.\\\\\n(ii) If a number is less than or equal to all of its adjacent numbers, then it is equal to $0$.\\\\\n\\\\\nDetermine the number of distinct gardens in terms of $m$ and $n$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h532231p3041818", "category": ""}
