{"answer": "39", "latex": "Seven marbles, each of which is either blue, red, or yellow, are in a box. It is known that there is a different amount of marbles for each color and there is at least $1$ marble of each color. Steve calculates the probability that the first $3$ marbles that he chooses are red. If the difference in the least and greatest probability that Steve can calculate is $\\frac{a}{b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime, what is $a+b$?\n", "category": ""}
