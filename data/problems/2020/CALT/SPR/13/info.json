{"answer": "169", "latex": "Bob is a weatherman for ``The World Daily''. He is reporting about the temperature in Orlando, Florida, as many tourists are flocking over to Orlando. He states that there is a $60\\%$ of chance of rain on Friday, and states if it does rain on Friday, there is a $70\\%$ chance of rain on Saturday. If there is no rain on Friday, then there would be a $50\\%$ chance of rain on Saturday. If it rains on Saturday, then there is a $80\\%$ chance of rain on Sunday. If it does not rain on Saturday, there is a $60\\%$ chance of rain on Sunday. If the probability that it rains exactly $2$ days is expressed as $\\frac{a}{b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime, find $a+b$.\n", "category": ""}
