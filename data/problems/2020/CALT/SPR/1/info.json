{"answer": "10", "latex": "Let $n$ be a positive integer. A banana slug is walking across a tightrope. Every $\\frac{1}{n}$th of the way across, it gains 30 grams in weight by eating a cracker. The tightrope can only hold 1000 grams of weight. If it's starting weight is $690$ grams, what is the largest possible value of $n$ such that the banana slug doesn't break the tightrope?\n", "category": ""}
