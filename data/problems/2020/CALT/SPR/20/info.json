{"answer": "332", "latex": "Bob has $2$ sets of all the integers from $1$ through $14$, inclusive. He first picks a number $n$ out of the first set and then chooses a number $m \\ne n$ uniformly at random from the second set subject to the following conditions:\n    \\begin{itemize}\n        \\item If $n$ is greater than $7$, then $m$ is less than $n$;\n        \\item If $n$ is less than $7$, then $m$ is greater than $n$;\n        \\item If $n$ equals $7$, then $m$ is chosen randomly.\n    \\end{itemize}\n    (For example, if Bob chose $12$ on his first pick, he has to choose a number less than $12$ on his second pick.)    If the expected value of the sum of the two numbers he picks can be expressed as $\\frac{a}{b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime, find $a+b$. \n", "category": ""}
