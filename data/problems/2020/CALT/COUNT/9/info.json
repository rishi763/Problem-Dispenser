Another ellipsoid has an axis that is half the axis of the first ellipsoid's first axis, and has a second axis that is $\\frac{2}{5}$ the axis of the first ellipsoid's second axis. If the second ellipsoid has ten times the volume of the first ellipsoid, what is the ratio of the second ellipsoid's third axis to the first ellipsoid's third axis? The volume of an ellipsoid is $\\frac{1}{6}abc\\pi$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the lengths of the ellipsoid's axes.\n", "category": ""}
