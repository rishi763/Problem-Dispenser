{"answer": "252", "latex": "Bob picks two integers from $1$ to $100$, inclusive, with replacement. Let the probability that the product of his two numbers is odd be $\\frac{a}{b}$, a common fraction. John does the same thing, but on the second pick, it cannot be the same number as before. Let the probability that the product of his numbers is odd be $\\frac{c}{d}$, a common fraction. Find $a+b+c+d$.\n", "category": ""}
