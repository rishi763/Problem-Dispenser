{"answer": "8", "latex": "Tim has an important test, and while he is very smart, he has trouble under pressure. The test consists of $3$ balanced questions.  At the beginning of the test, the probability that he gets a question correct is $\\tfrac 23$; however, every time he gets a question incorrect, this probability is halved.  (For exaample, if Tim gets the first and third questions correct but the second question incorrect, the probabilities of solving each question are $\\tfrac 23$, $\\tfrac23$, and $\\tfrac13$, respectively.) The expected value of the number of questions he gets correct can be written in the form $\\frac{a}{b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime positive integers.  Find $a+b$.\n", "category": ""}
