{"answer": "65", "latex": "Let $ABCD$ be a square with side length $5$. Point $P$ is chosen outside of the square such that $PA=4$ and $PB=3$, and $Q$ is the intersection point of lines $AP$ and $BD$.  The area of $\\triangle BPQ$ can be written in the form $\\frac{a}{b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime positive integers.  Find $a+b$.\n", "category": ""}
