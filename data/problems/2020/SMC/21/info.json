{"answer": "144", "latex": "In an construction project, $8$ workers working at the same rate complete $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the construction. Then $4$ of the workers start working at $\\frac{1}{2}$ the rate while the rest work at the original rate. Together, they complete $\\frac{3}{4}$ of the remaining work. The rest of the work is finished by only $4$ workers working at the original rate. The total construction time was $16$ months. Now, $8$ painters working at the same rate complete $\\frac{1}{2}$ of their job. They then start working $3$ times faster finishing the entire painting job in $4$ months. How long in months would it take for $1$ construction worker and $1$ painter, working at their original rates, to finish the entire project assuming the construction must be complete in order to start the painting?\n\n\n", "category": ""}
