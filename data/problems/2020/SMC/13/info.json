{"answer": "595", "latex": "A $10 \\times 10$ grid is numbered such that entries in row $i$ are numbered $10(i-1) + 1, 10(i-1) + 2, 10(i-1)+3,\\cdots, 10(i-1) + 10$ in increasing order. An ant wishes to take a path from the upper left corner of the grid to the bottom right corner of the grid, such that it can only move horizontally to the right or vertically to the bottom. Determine the minimum possible sum of the numbers that the ant passes through.\n\n\n", "category": ""}
