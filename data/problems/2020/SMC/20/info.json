Bob, being bad at counting, gives $40\\%$ more than he is supposed to. The waiter being good friends with Joe, decreases his bill by $30\\%$. Joe also gets a $40\\%$ discount. Finally, Joe tips $25\\%$. Now both of them paid the same amount. If both original prices were an integer amount of dollars, what is the smallest possible original price of Joe's meal(in dollars)?\n\n\n", "category": ""}
