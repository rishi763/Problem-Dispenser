{"answer": "2", "latex": "Ethan decides to construct a rectangle for a geometry problem, but scraps the idea and does algebra instead. He finds the area of the rectangle with positive integer side lengths $x$ and $y$, then subtracts $7$ times one side, and finally adds $3$ times the other side resulting in 25. How many possibilities are there for the ordered pair $(x , y)$?\n\n\n", "category": ""}
