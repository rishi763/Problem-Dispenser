However, as she suffers from short-term memory loss, she wants to keep it written down, but in a way that no one can steal it. So, she encrypts it. She uses the below formula to encrypt her message: $$\\text{encrypted number} = \\text{(secret number)}^e~(\\text{mod}~n).$$ In the formula, $n=55$ and $e=3.$ Given that $4^{10} = 1~(\\text{mod}~55)$ and $4^{5} = 34~(\\text{mod}~55)$ what is the smallest possible positive integer value of Dory's favorite number if her encrypted number is 4?\n\n\n====", "category": ""}
