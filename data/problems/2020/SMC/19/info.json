{"answer": "6", "latex": "Bob has a square paper with a side length of $48$ units. The unit squares in the top row are numbered from $1$ to $48$, the second row is numbered from $49$ to $96$ and so on until the $48$th row. The paper is then folded $4$ times:\n\\newline\n\n\n\\textbullet \\space The first fold brings the right half of the paper directly on the left half\n\n\n\\textbullet \\space The second fold brings the top half directly on top of the bottom half\n\n\n\\textbullet \\space The third fold brings the left half directly on top of the right half\n\n\n\\textbullet \\space The fourth fold brings the bottom half directly on top of the top half\n\\newline\\newline\nLet $m$ be the number of layers directly above unit square number $100$ and $n$ be the number of layers directly below unit square number $2100$. What is the units digit of $m!^{n!}$, where $a!$ indicates $1\\cdot2\\cdot3\\dots(a-1)\\cdot a$?\n", "category": ""}
