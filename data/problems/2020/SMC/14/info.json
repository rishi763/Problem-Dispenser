{"answer": "11", "latex": "Chords $\\overline{AB}$ and $\\overline{CD}$ are parallel chords in a circle, and $ABCD$ is a rectangle. Chord $\\overline{EF}$ intersects $\\overline{AB}$ and $\\overline{CD}$ at $G$ and $H$, respectively. Given that $DH=8$, $HF=1$, $HC=2$, and $\\angle GHC=120^\\circ,$ the length of $\\overline{BC}$ can be expressed as $m\\sqrt{n},$ where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. What is $m+n$?\n\n\n", "category": ""}
