{"answer": "101", "latex": "Define a sequence of functions recursively by $f_1(x) = |x-1|$ and $f_n(x)=f_{n-1}(|x-n|)$ for integers $n > 1$. Find the least value of $n$ such that the sum of the zeros of $f_n$ exceeds $500{,}000$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h2138187p15681098", "category": "A"}
