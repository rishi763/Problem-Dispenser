{"answer": "717", "latex": "Let $\\triangle ABC$ be an acute scalene triangle with circumcircle $\\omega$. The tangents to $\\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at $T$. Let $X$ and $Y$ be the projections of $T$ onto lines $AB$ and $AC$, respectively. Suppose $BT=CT=16$, $BC=22$, and $TX^2+TY^2+XY^2=1143$. Find $XY^2$.", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h2138159p15680911", "category": "G"}
