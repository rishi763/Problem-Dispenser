{"latex": "Prove that there exists a positive constant $c$ such that the following statement is true:\\\\\nConsider an integer $n > 1$, and a set $\\mathcal S$ of $n$ points in the plane such that the distance between any two different points in $\\mathcal S$ is at least 1. It follows that there is a line $\\ell$ separating $\\mathcal S$ such that the distance from any point of $\\mathcal S$ to $\\ell$ is at least $cn^{-1/3}$.\\\\\n\\\\\n(A line $\\ell$ separates a set of points S if some segment joining two points in $\\mathcal S$ crosses $\\ell$.)\\\\\n\\\\\n\\textit{Note.
