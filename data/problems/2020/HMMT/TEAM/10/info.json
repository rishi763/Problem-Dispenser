{"latex": "Let $n$ be a fixed positive integer, and choose $n$ positive integers $a_1, \\ldots , a_n$. Given a permutation $\\pi$ on the first $n$ positive integers, let $S_{\\pi}=\\{i\\mid \\frac{a_i}{\\pi(i)} \\text{ is an integer}\\}$. Let $N$ denote the number of distinct sets $S_{\\pi}$ as $\\pi$ ranges over all such permutations. Determine, in terms of $n$, the maximum value of $N$ over all possible values of $a_1, \\ldots , a_n$.\\\\\n\\\\\n\\textit{Proposed by James Lin.}", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c129h2008288p14065392", "category": ""}
