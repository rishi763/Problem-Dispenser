{"latex": "Let $ABCD$ be a rectangle and $E$ be a point on segment $AD$. We are given that quadrilateral $BCDE$ has an inscribed circle $\\omega_1$ that is tangent to $BE$ at $T$. If the incircle $\\omega_2$ of $ABE$ is also tangent to $BE$ at $T$, then find the ratio of the radius of $\\omega_1$ to the radius of $\\omega_2$.\\\\\n\\\\\n\\textit{Proposed by James Lin.}", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c129h2008240p14065119", "category": ""}
