{"latex": "Alice writes $1001$ letters on a blackboard, each one chosen independently and uniformly at random from the set $S=\\{a, b, c\\}$. A move consists of erasing two distinct letters from the board and replacing them with the third letter in $S$. What is the probability that Alice can perform a sequence of moves which results in one letter remaining on the blackboard?\\\\\n\\\\\n\\textit{Proposed by Daniel Zhu.}", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c129h2008268p14065306", "category": ""}
