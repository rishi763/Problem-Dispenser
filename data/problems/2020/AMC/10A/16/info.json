{"answer": "B", "latex": "A point is chosen at random within the square in the coordinate plane whose vertices are $(0, 0), (2020, 0), (2020, 2020),$ and $(0, 2020)$. The probability that the point is within $d$ units of a lattice point is $\\tfrac{1}{2}$. (A point $(x, y)$ is a lattice point if $x$ and $y$ are both integers.) What is $d$ to the nearest tenth$?$\\\\\n\\\\\n$\\textbf{(A) } 0.3 \\qquad \\textbf{(B) } 0.4 \\qquad \\textbf{(C) } 0.5 \\qquad \\textbf{(D) } 0.6 \\qquad \\textbf{(E) } 0.7$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h1997705p13948074", "category": "A"}
