{"answer": "B", "latex": "A frog sitting at the point $(1, 2)$ begins a sequence of jumps, where each jump is parallel to one of the coordinate axes and has length $1$, and the direction of each jump (up, down, right, or left) is chosen independently at random. The sequence ends when the frog reaches a side of the square with vertices $(0,0), (0,4), (4,4),$ and $(4,0)$. What is the probability that the sequence of jumps ends on a vertical side of the square$?$\\\\\n\\\\\n$\\textbf{(A) } \\frac{1}{2} \\qquad \\textbf{(B) } \\frac{5}{8} \\qquad \\textbf{(C) } \\frac{2}{3} \\qquad \\textbf{(D) } \\frac{3}{4} \\qquad \\textbf{(E) } \\frac{7}{8}$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h1997658p13947484", "category": ""}
