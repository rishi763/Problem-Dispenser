{"answer": "A", "latex": "Let $T$ be the triangle in the coordinate plane with vertices $\\left(0,0\\right)$, $\\left(4,0\\right)$, and $\\left(0,3\\right)$. Consider the following five isometries (rigid transformations) of the plane: rotations of $90^{\\circ}$, $180^{\\circ}$, and $270^{\\circ}$ counterclockwise around the origin, reflection across the $x$-axis, and reflection across the $y$-axis. How many of the $125$ sequences of three of these transformations (not necessarily distinct) will return $T$ to its original position? (For example, a $180^{\\circ}$ rotation, followed by a reflection across the $x$-axis, followed by a reflection across the $y$-axis will return $T$ to its original position, but a $90^{\\circ}$ rotation, followed by a reflection across the $x$-axis, followed by another reflection across the $x$-axis will not return $T$ to its original position.)\\\\\n\\\\\n$\\textbf{(A) } 12\\qquad\\textbf{(B) } 15\\qquad\\textbf{(C) }17 \\qquad\\textbf{(D) }20 \\qquad\\textbf{(E) }25$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h1997661p13947490", "category": ""}
