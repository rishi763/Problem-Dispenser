{"answer": "A", "latex": "Bela and Jenn play the following game on the closed interval $[0, n]$ of the real number line, where $n$ is a fixed integer greater than $4$. They take turns playing, with Bela going first. At his first turn, Bela chooses any real number in the interval $[0, n]$. Thereafter, the player whose turn it is chooses a real number that is more than one unit away from all numbers previously chosen by either player. A player unable to choose such a number loses. Using optimal strategy, which player will win the game?\\\\\n\\\\\n$\\textbf{(A) } \\text{Bela will always win.}$\\\\\n$\\textbf{(B) } \\text{Jenn will always win.} $\\\\\n$\\textbf{(C) } \\text{Bela will win if and only if }n \\text{ is odd.}$\\\\\n$\\textbf{(D) } \\text{Jenn will win if and only if }n \\text{ is odd.} $\\\\\n$\\textbf{(E) } \\text{Jenn will win if and only if }n > 8.$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h2002020p13997264", "category": ""}
