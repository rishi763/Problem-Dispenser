What is the sum of the three digits that were then in the positions $2019, 2020, 2021$?\\\\\n\\\\\n$\\textbf{(A) } 7 \\qquad\\textbf{(B) } 9 \\qquad\\textbf{(C) } 10 \\qquad\\textbf{(D) } 11 \\qquad\\textbf{(E) } 12$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h2002009p13997143", "category": ""}
