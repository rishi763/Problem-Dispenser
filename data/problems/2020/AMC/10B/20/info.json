{"answer": "B", "latex": "Let $B$ be a right rectangular prism (box) with edges lengths $1,$ $3,$ and $4$, together with its interior. For real $r\\geq0$, let $S(r)$ be the set of points in $3$-dimensional space that lie within a distance $r$ of some point $B$. The volume of $S(r)$ can be expressed as $ar^{3} + br^{2} + cr +d$, where $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ and $d$ are positive real numbers. What is $\\frac{bc}{ad}?$\\\\\n\\\\\n$\\textbf{(A) } 6 \\qquad\\textbf{(B) } 19 \\qquad\\textbf{(C) } 24 \\qquad\\textbf{(D) } 26 \\qquad\\textbf{(E) } 38$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h2002021p13997270", "category": ""}
