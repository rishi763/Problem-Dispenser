{"answer": "C", "latex": "Square $ABCD$ in the coordinate plane has vertices at the points $A(1,1), B(-1,1), C(-1,-1),$ and $D(1,-1).$ Consider the following four transformations:\\\\\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item $L,$ a rotation of $90^{\\circ}$ counterclockwise around the origin;\n\\item $R,$ a rotation of $90^{\\circ}$ clockwise around the origin;\n\\item $H,$ a reflection across the $x$-axis; and\n\\item $V,$ a reflection across the $y$-axis.\n\\end{itemize}\nEach of these transformations maps the squares onto itself, but the positions of the labeled vertices will change. For example, applying $R$ and then $V$ would send the vertex $A$ at $(1,1)$ to $(-1,-1)$ and would send the vertex $B$ at $(-1,1)$ to itself. How many sequences of $20$ transformations chosen from $\\{L, R, H, V\\}$ will send all of the labeled vertices back to their original positions? (For example, $R, R, V, H$ is one sequence of $4$ transformations that will send the vertices back to their original positions.)\\\\\n\\\\\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ 2^{37} \\qquad\\textbf{(B)}\\ 3\\cdot 2^{36} \\qquad\\textbf{(C)}\\  2^{38} \\qquad\\textbf{(D)}\\ 3\\cdot 2^{37} \\qquad\\textbf{(E)}\\ 2^{39}$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h2002011p13997192", "category": ""}
