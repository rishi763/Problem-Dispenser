{"answer": "B", "latex": "Andy the Ant lives on a coordinate plane and is currently at $(-20, 20)$ facing east (that is, in the positive $x$-direction). Andy moves $1$ unit and then turns $90^{\\circ}$ degrees left. From there, Andy moves $2$ units (north) and then turns $90^{\\circ}$ degrees left. He then moves $3$ units (west) and again turns $90^{\\circ}$ degrees left. Andy continues his progress, increasing his distance each time by $1$ unit and always turning left. What is the location of the point at which Andy makes the $2020$th left turn?\\\\\n\\\\\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ (-1030, -994)\\qquad\\textbf{(B)}\\ (-1030, -990)\\qquad\\textbf{(C)}\\ (-1026, -994)\\qquad\\textbf{(D)}\\ (-1026, -990)\\qquad\\textbf{(E)}\\ (-1022, -994)$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h2002025p13997362", "category": ""}
