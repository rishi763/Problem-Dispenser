{"answer": "A", "latex": "A game board consists of $64$ squares that alternate in color between black and white. The figure below shows square $P$ in the bottom and square $Q$ in the top row. A marker is placed at $P$. A \\textit{step} consists of moving the marker onto one of the adjoining white squares in the row above. How many $7$-step paths are there from $P$ to $Q$? (The figure shows a sample path.)\\\\\n\\\\\n\n\\begin{asy}\nimport olympiad;\nimport cse5;\ndefaultpen(white);\nsize(100);\n//diagram by SirCalcsALot\nsize(200); int[] x = {6, 5, 4, 5, 6, 5, 6}; int[] y = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}; int N = 7; for (int i = 0; i < 8; ++i) { for (int j = 0; j < 8; ++j) { draw((i,j)--(i+1,j)--(i+1,j+1)--(i,j+1)--(i,j)); if ((i+j) % 2 == 0) { filldraw((i,j)--(i+1,j)--(i+1,j+1)--(i,j+1)--(i,j)--cycle,black); } } } for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) { draw(circle((x[i],y[i])+(0.5,0.5),0.35)); } label(\"$P$\", (5.5, 0.5)); label(\"$Q$\", (6.5, 7.5)); \n\\end{asy}\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ 28 \\qquad \\textbf{(B)}\\ 30 \\qquad \\textbf{(C)}\\ 32 \\qquad \\textbf{(D)}\\ 33 \\qquad \\textbf{(E)}\\ 35$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h2345533p18953756", "category": ""}
