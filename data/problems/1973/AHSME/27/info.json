{"answer": "A", "latex": "Cars A and B travel the same distance.  Care A travels half that \\textit{distance} at $ u$ miles per hour and half at $ v$ miles per hour.  Car B travels half the \\textit{time} at $ u$ miles per hour and half at $ v$ miles per hour.  The average speed of Car A is $ x$ miles per hour and that of Car B is $ y$ miles per hour.  Then we always have\\\\\n\\\\\n$ \\textbf{(A)}\\ x \\leq y\\qquad \n\\textbf{(B)}\\ x \\geq y \\qquad \n\\textbf{(C)}\\ x=y \\qquad \n\\textbf{(D)}\\ x<y\\qquad \n\\textbf{(E)}\\ x>y$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c4h335155p1793743", "category": "A"}
