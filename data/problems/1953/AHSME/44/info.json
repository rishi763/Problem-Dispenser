{"answer": "A", "latex": "In solving a problem that reduces to a quadratic equation one student makes a mistake only in the constant term of the equation and obtains $ 8$ and $ 2$ for the roots. Another student makes a mistake only in the coefficient of the first degree term and find $ -9$ and $ -1$ for the roots. The correct equation was:\\\\\n$ \\textbf{(A)}\\ x^2-10x+9=0 \\qquad\\textbf{(B)}\\ x^2+10x+9=0 \\qquad\\textbf{(C)}\\ x^2-10x+16=0\\\\\n\\textbf{(D)}\\ x^2-8x-9=0 \\qquad\\textbf{(E)}\\ \\text{none of these}$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c4h255792p1396644", "category": ""}
