{"answer": "B", "latex": "$A$ gives $B$ as many cents as $B$ has and $C$ as many cents as $C$ has. Similarly, $B$ then gives $A$ and $C$ as many cents as each then has. $C$, similarly, then gives $A$ and $B$ as many cents as each then has. If each finally has $16$ cents, with how many cents does $A$ start?\\\\\n\\\\\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ 24 \\qquad\n\\textbf{(B)}\\ 26\\qquad\n\\textbf{(C)}\\ 28 \\qquad\n\\textbf{(D)}\\ 30 \\qquad\n\\textbf{(E)}\\ 32$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h570674p3351577", "category": "A"}
