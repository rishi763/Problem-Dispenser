{"answer": "B", "latex": "Point $P$ is taken interior to a square with side-length $a$ and such that is it equally distant from two consecutive vertices and from the side opposite these vertices. If $d$ represents the common distance, then $d$ equals:\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ \\dfrac{3a}{5} \\qquad\n\\textbf{(B)}\\ \\dfrac{5a}{8} \\qquad\n\\textbf{(C)}\\ \\dfrac{3a}{8} \\qquad\n\\textbf{(D)}\\ \\dfrac{a\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\qquad\n\\textbf{(E)}\\ \\dfrac{a}{2}$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h570433p3349885", "category": "G"}
