{"answer": "D", "latex": "Two men at points $R$ and $S$, $76$ miles apart, set out at the same time to walk towards each other. The man at $R$ walks uniformly at the rate of $4\\dfrac{1}{2}$ miles per hour; the man at $S$ walks at the constant rate of $3\\dfrac{1}{4}$ miles per hour for the first hour, at $3\\dfrac{3}{4}$ miles per hour for the second hour,\\\\\nand so on, in arithmetic progression. If the men meet $x$ miles nearer $R$ than $S$ in an integral number of hours, then $x$ is:\\\\\n\\\\\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ 10 \\qquad\n\\textbf{(B)}\\ 8 \\qquad\n\\textbf{(C)}\\ 6 \\qquad\n\\textbf{(D)}\\ 4 \\qquad\n\\textbf{(E)}\\ 2$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h570448p3349936", "category": "A"}
