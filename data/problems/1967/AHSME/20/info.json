{"answer": "A", "latex": "A circle is inscribed in a square of side $m$, then a square is inscribed in that  circle, then a circle is inscribed in the latter square, and so on.  If $S_n$ is the sum of the areas of the first $n$ circles so inscribed, then, as $n$ grows beyond all bounds, $S_n$ approaches:\\\\\n\\\\\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ \\frac{\\pi m^2}{2}\\qquad\n\\textbf{(B)}\\ \\frac{3\\pi m^2}{8}\\qquad\n\\textbf{(C)}\\ \\frac{\\pi m^2}{3}\\qquad\n\\textbf{(D)}\\ \\frac{\\pi m^2}{4}\\qquad\n\\textbf{(E)}\\ \\frac{\\pi m^2}{8}$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h413275p2322503", "category": "G"}
