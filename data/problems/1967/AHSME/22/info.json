{"answer": "A", "latex": "For natural numbers, when $P$ is divided by $D$, the quotient is $Q$ and the remainder is $R$.  When $Q$ is divided by $D'$, the quotient is $Q'$ and the remainder is $R'$.  Then, when $P$ is divided by $DD'$, the remainder is:\\\\\n\\\\\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ R+R'D\\qquad\n\\textbf{(B)}\\ R'+RD\\qquad\n\\textbf{(C)}\\ RR'\\qquad\n\\textbf{(D)}\\ R\\qquad\n\\textbf{(E)}\\ R'$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h413278p2322549", "category": "N"}
