{"answer": "E", "latex": "Given a set $S$ consisting of two undefined elements \"pib\" and \"maa\", and the four postulates: $P_1$: Every pib is a collection of maas, $P_2$: Any two distinct pibs have one and only one maa in common, $P_3$: Every maa belongs to two and only two pibs, $P_4$: There are exactly four pibs.  Consider the three theorems: $T_1$: There are exactly six maas, $T_2$: There are exactly three maas in each pib, $T_3$: For each maa there is exactly one other maa not in the same pid with it.  The theorems which are deducible from the postulates are:\\\\\n\\\\\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ T_3 \\; \\text{only}\\qquad\n\\textbf{(B)}\\ T_2 \\; \\text{and} \\; T_3 \\; \\text{only} \\qquad\n\\textbf{(C)}\\ T_1 \\; \\text{and} \\; T_2 \\; \\text{only}\\\\\n\\textbf{(D)}\\ T_1 \\; \\text{and} \\; T_3 \\; \\text{only}\\qquad\n\\textbf{(E)}\\ \\text{all}$", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h413456p2323782", "category": ""}
